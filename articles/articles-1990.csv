There's none of the nihilistic craziness of William Burroughs or Jean Genet in his bland meditations on criminality, nor any suggestion of remorse. The message of ""Smack Goddess"" is banal: Crime pays. In the end, Sonny escapes from a minimum security prison and fetches up in the paradise of Jamaica, still bored, still dealing dope -- yet somehow the very picture of health and vitality. Never mind that a lot of people, including loved ones, have ended up in dumpsters or otherwise dead. The notion of consequences, of a moral life, is absent from this book. ""Smack Goddess"" is about obtaining satisfaction -- no matter how. Sonny and Grimm are empty souls; their love is simply a matter of great sex.

In Iowa, at ''one of the more prestigious writing schools,'' she suffered unrequited love, dropped a hallucinogen and thereby learned what Tony the dog was thinking. In Ibiza, she got to know Anita and Luisa, smoked some hashish, paid Luisa 10 American dollars to sleep with her but got Anita to do it for free.

In August 1947, 24-year-old Carolyn Robinson found her boyfriend, Neal Cassady, naked in bed with his estranged wife and his friend Allen Ginsberg. The next year - on April Fool's Day - she married Cassady, and she spent the next 20 years amid the neurotic heroes of the Beat Generation. In ''Off the Road,'' Ms. Cassady confessionally chronicles their weird and wild escapades, which involved promiscuity, jail sentences and haphazard careers, as well as experimentation with marijuana, hashish, LSD and peyote. In 1952, Jack Kerouac moved into the Cassadys' New York City apartment. While still married to Neal, Ms. Cassady had an affair with Kerouac and became, in the words of Allen Ginsberg, Jack's ''Ideal Mother Image, Madwoman, chick and ignu.'' (''The last word,'' the poet explained, ''means a special honorary type post-hip intellectual. Its main root is ignoramus.'') While living with the Cassadys, Kerouac finished writing ''On the Road,'' which immortalized Cassady in the character of Dean Moriarty. The Cassadys eventually divorced, and Neal Cassady died in 1968, at the age of 43. Nearly two years later, at the age of 47, Kerouac died. This sometimes pathetic story culminates with one of Cassady's other wives calling Carolyn for Neal's ashes, then deciding to bury them in Kerouac's grave. Ms. Cassady, passive to the end, agrees to the odd request. Unfortunately, the author offers very little insight into her masochism and self-destructive tendencies. It's hard to swallow her portrayal of herself as a victimized good girl among the bad-boy beatniks and their harem. Still, ''Off the Road'' is rich with gossip, historically significant photographs, intimate memories, unpublished letters and - alas - bad poetry from the Beats.",Married to the Beats,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/02/books/in-short-nonfiction-married-to-the-beats.html

The ''Concert Champetre'' written for Wanda Landowska, is in the composer's brightest, most irrepressible, Peter Pan style. The slow movement has a plangent lyricism unusual even for Poulenc. The most serious of the three, and also the most often played, is the Organ Concerto, full of Stravinskyisms in which Poulenc's personality comes through strongly. All of the performances are excellent, though the engineers could have done a little more to bring up the harpsichord in ''Champetre.'' Still, a most attractive disk. - Harold C.

New Order has found international popularity; there's no shortage of alienated, cultish listeners. Where basic punk black is the wardrobe for New Order and its followers, the new Manchester music arrives in an explosion of flower patterns and Day-Glo colors; its trappings evoke every hedonistic pop style from psychedelia to disco. The open drug use - ''marijuana keeps that smile upon my face,'' sings Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays - is another kind of escapism (and one that might not migrate to the United States in the just-say-no era). While Stone Roses, who stand slightly apart from the rest of the Manchester bands, write concise folk-rock songs, the other groups depend on the trippy combination of a drone and an unstoppable beat, whether they rely on post-disco synthesizers (808 State, Adamski, A Guy Called Gerald) or guitar (Happy Mondays) or organ (Inspiral Carpets).",Manchester's Pop Music: Escapism Without Escape,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/29/arts/recordings-manchester-s-pop-music-escapism-without-escape.html

It's psychedelia turned dystopian; no wonder Happy Mondays' 1989 album is called ''Bummed.''

But that historical route really has very few ties to modern-day grand juries, which were made part of our law by the U.S. Constitution in the Fifth Amendment. The role envisioned then was the grand jury as a buffer between the zealous prosecutor and the citizens. Interestingly, the grand jury provision of the Fifth Amendment is one of the few parts of the Bill of Rights that the courts have not made mandatory to the states. Grand juries have moved somewhat into disfavor in modern times and are required now in only about one-third of the states, including New York.",WESTCHESTER Q&A;: BARBARA C.

Cases such as the Brady and Ruth Washington ones, where the prosecutor may not be proceeding as aggressively as the public thinks he should, are rare. It's usually the other way around. The general theory is that any good prosecutor can get an indictment against anyone. The Goetz case was an interesting example of that flexibility, if you will, of district attorneys before a grand jury. The first time the case was presented, I believe, the grand jury didn't indict. At the time the political climate was such that District Attorney Robert Morganthau's office thought that was the most advisable outcome.",WESTCHESTER Q&A;: BARBARA C.

In many states, instead of a grand jury a preliminary hearing is used to determine if there is probable cause to hold someone. New York provides for a preliminary hearing prior to grand jury, but really only at the option of the prosecutor. In Westchester, interestingly, prosecutors use the preliminary hearing very frequently, but in New York City they are things of the past. The way to avoid a felony hearing is to present the case to the grand jury within five days of an arrest.

That it does continue to be the conscience of the community in those cases where there has been a violation of a law that the public no longer thinks is a good law - for example, marijuana possession cases at the time that mere possession carried very stiff penalties. Many times grand juries simply wouldn't indict. Nowadays, in cases where guns aren't properly registered there is frequently no indictment voted.

No. The reason grand jury proceedings are so private goes back to the other function of the grand jury: its investigatory role. It is a powerful weapon for the prosecutor because the grand jury has subpoena power. People cannot refuse to come and cannot refuse to testify.

But they say that the judge said the prosecutors charge to the grand jury was improper. I can't imagine any prosecutor, even the most inexperienced one, telling a grand jury that it has to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt before it can indict. Prosecutors operate in the grand jury every single day; this is their arena. They know well that a prima facie case - probable cause - is all that is needed to move forward with an indictment.

But there is no longer any doubt that the perennial iconoclast-author William Burroughs has been given a lifetime pass to the rock-and-roll circus. The bassist and songwriter Bill Laswell, leading a loose assemblage of players he calls Material, recently drafted the writer to read excerpts from his latest novel, ''The Western Lands,'' as part of the album ''Seven Souls'' (Virgin 91360; CD and cassette). And last year, the group Manapsara released ''Queer: A Soundtrack to the Novel by William S. Burroughs'' (Sub Rosa, SUB 33017-22; all three formats, Belgian import), based on one of his early texts. Such tributes are no surprise, given that the 76-year-old Mr. Burroughs has been hanging around the outskirts of rock music since the 1960's, his influence spreading slowly.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

The British jazz-rockers Soft Machine took their name from his 1966 novel; a successful art-pop group in the early 1970's called themselves Steely Dan after a grotesque sex toy in ''Naked Lunch.'' The critic Lester Bangs said he had thought of the term heavy metal for thunderous guitar music in part from reading about Mr. Burroughs's Heavy Metal Kids in ''The Soft Machine.''","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

Mr. Burroughs's favorite themes of surrealistic homosexuality and deadpan drug addiction seemed more compatible with the rock agenda. His images of slime pools filled with Venusian frog-boys and ruined cities with zombie assassins slithering around street corners foreshadowed punk angst. And certainly the random violence of his cut-up sentences fascinated David Bowie in his ''Lodger'' album. The style also became a fetish for the gay-punk pioneers Dead Fingers Talk and the industrial noisemakers Throbbing Gristle.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

Early in her career, Patti Smith acknowledged his inspiration, notably in the title track of her 1975 debut album, ''Horses.'' And Laurie Anderson helped play host to the 1978 Nova Convention in New York, which honored Mr. Burroughs's contributions to the counterculture with performances by Philip Glass, Frank Zappa and Ms. Smith. Fascinated by the author's creative longevity as well as his arid croak of a voice, Ms. Anderson brought Mr. Burroughs into her act as a narrator for the number ''Sharkey's Night'' on her 1984 ''Mister Heartbreak'' album.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

Material, which has been almost dormant since the pop-funk extravaganza ''One Down'' in 1982, now consists of Mr. Laswell and whatever confederates he deems appropriate to the project at hand. The assembled crew for ''Seven Souls'' includes the guitarist and sitar player Nicky Skopelitis, the violinist L. Shankar and the master reggae drummer Sly Dunbar; as this lineup would suggest, Mr. Laswell is taking the measure of world music here. Considering the fact that Mr. Burroughs has long been fascinated with Morocco and sprinkles mythology from ancient Egypt and elsewhere throughout ''The Western Lands,'' desert rhythms and drones seem suitable in ''Seven Souls.'' Several passages on the album develop into vigorously dramatic readings-with-music. In the title number, Mr. Burroughs enumerates the function and character of the Egyptian souls while gurgling bass and wafting synthesizer pile up tension until it snaps with a rising, plangent rhythm phrase. The sound seems to drive the fleeing souls toward afterlife in the Western Lands. Like the old-time Beats chanting poetry to jazz improvisations, Material gives Mr. Burroughs a rich, contemporary backdrop for his declamations. ''Seven Souls'' also represents the canniest use ever of Mr. Burroughs's dry tonality; he blends so well into the five tracks that feature him you can imagine his voice as a taped sound effect, the reedy murmuring of a Midwestern prairie lizard.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

The band consists of the instrumentalists Bradley Koehler and Christopher Hartman, whose liner notes summarize the aspects of the novel they are trying to wrap in purely electronic and broadly impressionistic sounds. The story concerns the search by Mr. Burroughs and his reluctant companion Allerton in a South American jungle for yage, a drug that purportedly gives the user the power of telepathy.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

One track, ''A Modicum of Truth,'' begins with mildly Latin dance beats crushed together like an imploding Mexican disco. The next number, ''Phantom Presence,'' swirls with electronic horror-movie gasps. When the synthesizers drop agitated rhythm backing for interludes of yearning or dreamlike sounds, the quest for yage bogs down badly. Despite this and other lapses like shoddy imitations of thunder and surf and too many spooky voices, ''Queer'' is sometimes densely atmospheric. Heard from a distance with less than full attention, it suggests a sinister, tropical mutation of a New Age record.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

The attraction that experimental rockers have for his experimental writing is broader, more penetrating and more informal than either Material or Manapsar's manifestations of it. Mr. Burroughs is at once a crotchety geezer and an insurrectionist, an ageless bad boy battling to write his way free from boredom, convention and finally death.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

Even so, the elderly Mr. Burroughs often writes with his own generation's music in mind (he invokes ''Red Sails in the Sunset'' on the Material album), and perhaps his prose would be best accompanied by a Hoagy Carmichael tune with totally depraved lyrics, or a Jelly Roll Morton blues run through a player piano with missing keys.","Zombie Assassins, Desert Rhythms and the Beats",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/arts/pop-zombie-assassins-desert-rhythms-and-the-beats.html

In Berkeley, Calif., in 1966, the future progenitor of Rolling Stone magazine was both a ''dope-smoking liberal'' and constantly ''begging for invitations to deb parties''; a college roommate concluded he was motivated ''purely by opportunism.'' To get his magazine going, he first stole his main competitor's mailing list, then appropriated the competitor's name (Straight Arrow) for his publishing company. Early subscribers received roach clips (to hold marijuana joints) with every paid subscription; a roach-clip designer became the magazine's second art director, and a pot dealer was one of its first copy editors. Later Mr. Wenner's favorite props became vodka and cocaine, and his wife told a friend that the editor and publisher was ''the only person I know who can spend twenty thousand dollars a year on coke and gain twenty pounds.''",A ROACH CLIP WITH EVERY PAID SUBSCRIPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/17/books/a-roach-clip-with-every-paid-subscription.html

When Greil Marcus, one of his most talented employees, gave a mixed notice to Bob Dylan's album ''Self-Portrait,'' Mr. Wenner fired him. One recalcitrant writer who couldn't make deadlines was given amphetamines by the editor himself: ''All right,'' Mr. Wenner would say, ''it's time for your prescription.''

Friends of Mr. Wenner's like Art Garfunkel, Judy Belushi and Tom Cruise have all been allowed to edit their own interviews or alter their quotations.

Gleason told a reporter: ''I don't think it is possible for a generation that has listened to Bob Dylan . . . even to look at the idea of working for IBM and retiring with a pension when they're 65 the way their fathers did.

Among the examples: Perception: a psychedelic van/reality: a smart-looking sports car. Perception: George McGovern/reality: Ronald Reagan (for whom Mr. Wenner had cast his vote in 1980). And finally: Perception: ''All You Need Is Love''/reality: ''What's Love Got to Do With It?'' The only pairing Mr. Wenner rejected was a peace symbol and the hood ornament of a Mercedes-Benz.

Diagnosed by a military psychiatrist as a ''constitutional psychopath'' chiefly because (like Louis Armstrong) he enjoyed smoking marijuana and refused to pretend otherwise, Young spent most of 1945 in the prison barracks at Fort Gordon in Georgia, deep in the heart of Jim Crow country. The experience broke him. As a teen-ager, he had listened avidly to the records of Bix Beiderbecke; as an adult, he followed Beiderbecke down the path of drunkenness and despair. In the years between his dishonorable discharge and his death in 1959 at the age of 49, Young's playing, always suffused with the haunting cry of the blues, acquired the heavy gray patina of disillusion.

Although occasionally jumpy, THE WOODCHOPPER'S BALL: The Autobiography of Woody Herman (Dutton, $18.95) gives us a feel for Woody Herman, who until his death at the age of 74 in 1987 gave us five decades of outstanding music and provided an outlet for scores of talented jazz musicians who subsequently emerged as important figures, such as Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Jimmy Giuffre, Milt Jackson and Gene Ammons. The story of the clarinetist and saxophonist, joyful at points, ultimately borders on the horrific. By 1946, Herman - along with other notable white bandleaders of his day, among them Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw - had made a fortune. Yet he died impoverished, his house (purchased from Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) impounded. Like the stories of many fallen celebrities, Herman's tale - written with Stuart Troup, Newsday's jazz critic, who finished the book after Herman's death - is filled with naivete, ignorance and ironic twists. Abe Turchen, Herman's trusted business manager, ignored the Internal Revenue Service - for two decades. A resilient man with a dry sense of humor, Herman globetrotted on behalf of the State Department while he paid back taxes to the tune of $1,000 a week on a 20-year-old bill that, after penalties and interest, totaled more than $1.6 million. Durable, honest, he hated nostalgia but recognized his standing in show biz and knew that his selections sometimes bordered on pop. He worked with Igor Stravinsky; he worked lesser jobs, such as trade shows, dances and state fairs. ''We also performed at Freedomland . . . a rinky-dink version of Disneyland up in the Bronx. A booker tried to sell us in Las Vegas, but we got no takers.'' He met Woody Allen in 1963 when the two had offices in the same Manhattan building. ''I'd run into him on the elevator and say, 'Hi, I'm the old one.' He and I had to play clarinets together once on 'The Tonight Show' and it was a horrible experience.'' Mr. Troup lets us know that he idolized Herman, whom he met as a child 45 years ago. The writer is reverent; sometimes large doses of sentiment seep through.

''There was nothing to do,'' he writes with annoying arrogance, but pursue drink, sex and money, ''and no hope that there would ever be more to it than that.'' He returns to South Africa to write a book - one of the anguished, mannered memoirs, halfway between confession and apology, with a standard via dolorosa of the Afrikaners tagged on, that seem to come out lately every year.",NIGHTMARE OF THE AFRIKANER,https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/books/nightmare-of-the-afrikaner.html

The violence had begun in 1984 with protests against then President P. W. Botha's parliamentary reforms, which, in a blatant divide-and-rule move, gave mock representation to ''coloreds'' (those of mixed race) and Asians, none to blacks. The Government lashed out at the protesters through seemingly controlled, systemic violence that could barely contain the fear and panic that lay behind it and that stimulated acts of mindless cruelty. By June 12, 1986, when Mr. Botha effectively declared war on the protesters, hundreds of thousands of blacks had been tear-gassed, at least 10,000 had been wounded, and some 1,700 killed.

His book ends with the story of Neil and Creina Alcock, a white farming couple who lived with the Zulus as the Zulus themselves lived, in poverty, and who valiantly - foolhardily, most would say - tried to create a workable agriculture, a livable existence, in a land so poor that it was called the Place of Lost Grasses. Neil Alcock was murdered when he tried to resolve a tribal feud, and later deified. Creina Alcock stayed, stubbornly. ''Trusting is dangerous,'' she told the author. ''But without trust there is no hope for love, and love is all we ever have to hold against the dark.''

And here's the letter again - what does it mean? - with all the death imagery in this novel, with its use of old Amerindian death myths. Are we being told that America in 1984 is in fact the land of the dead, V-land, the universe beyond the zero? One could do a number of further riffs on the more allegorical of the names: Weed - marijuana, and Atman - soul; and, hey, Frenesi turns out to be an anagram of ''free'' and ''sin,'' the two sides of her nature, light and dark, just as the hero of ''Gravity's Rainbow,'' Tyrone Slothrop, could be made to reveal his essence anagrammatically, turning into ''sloth or entropy.''

His first novel, ''Emergency'' (1964), broke new ground by exploring the forces that might lead an ordinary, decent black to become involved in the armed struggle against apartheid - a subject since examined with even fiercer passion by Mongane Serote (in ''To Every Birth Its Blood''), Sipho Sepamla (in ''A Ride on the Whirlwind'') and Mbulelo Mzamane (in ''The Children of Soweto''). Spanning the three decades from the 50's to the mid-80's, ''Advance, Retreat'' contains some of Rive's finest stories and provides a loose chronology of the mixed-race population's evolving political consciousness.","'MA, WHY DID YOU MAKE ME BLACK?'",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/books/ma-why-did-you-make-me-black.html

The only other brown face in the crowded room besides Ma. And even the Old-Woman was paler in death.'' Mavis recalls how she directed her anger toward her mother, refusing to comfort her when she complained of being ignored by the very children she had at one time favored: ''Don't you understand that you are black and your bloody children are white! Jim and Rosie and Sonny are white! And you made me like you. You made me black! . . . Ma, why did you make me black?'' As she hurries away from the corrupt ceremony, Mavis's unspoken revelation, her resurrection, is the awareness of her own failure to make common cause with her black mother.","'MA, WHY DID YOU MAKE ME BLACK?'",https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/books/ma-why-did-you-make-me-black.html

The characters sometimes come close to being stereotypes - this is because their society shapes and confines every interaction.
