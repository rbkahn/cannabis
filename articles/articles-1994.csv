Big Time Sarah does everything a good-time blues belter has to do: she shouts, she rasps, she wails, she slings double-entendres and she gets the audience to join in. Her group, the B.T.S.

Take the raucous twang of rocked-up rockabilly and splash on the tone clusters and manic piano pounding that link Jerry Lee Lewis to Sun Ra. Add to a seemingly bottomless repertory of well-known and obscure old songs, throw in some jovial pop originals by the band, and this results in N.R.B.Q., a band as unpredictable as it is seasoned. The Motorkings, led by Frank Funaro, formerly the Del-Lords' drummer, are to share the bill. Admission to the early show, at 9:30 P.M., is $30; the late show, at 1 A.M., is $25. J. P.

Her lyrics aren't always simple exhortations to dance; her 1991 hit, ""Gypsy Woman,"" combined an irresistible ""la-da-dee, la-da-dah"" chorus with verses about a homeless woman. Lords of Acid, from Belgium, combine fast, propulsive techno music with lyrics about as many taboos as they can formulate. ""I want to talk to you about the forbidden pleasures of the flesh,"" a woman announces to open a single called ""The Crablouse.""

Plant lovers and bibliophiles alike will greet Nicolas Barker's extraordinarily handsome book about another book with jubilation, even though its title may be confusing at first. The original ""Hortus Eystettensis"" was a florilegium made up of 367 copperplate engravings commissioned by Johann Conrad von Gemmingen, the wealthy and horticulturally passionate Bishop of Eichstatt in Bavaria. A year after he died in 1612, the plates were published by Basilius Besler, an apothecary and amateur botanist in Nuremberg. Although the plates were in black and white, a few copies of the entire book were subsequently colored by hand. These eventually found their way into libraries in Paris, Brussels, Munich and other cities, and also into the hands of European and American private collectors.",GARDENING,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/books/christmas-books-94-gardening.html

The other half consists of 50 color plates, reproduced at half their original size, taken from many different copies of the Bishop's book, and also of smaller plates that show differences in color from one copy to another. These sumptuous illustrations show that many of the plants that fascinated flower lovers in the 17th century still loom large in our own affections today.

With this book, Mr. Clancy stakes his claim to being the most politically correct popular author in America, which is somewhat remarkable in such an outspoken, if not fire-breathing, right winger as himself. Practically everyone is either black, Hispanic, a woman or, at a minimum, ethnic. The Vice President is hauled off on charges of sexual harassment; the Japanese Prime Minister is a rapist; the deputy director of operations at the C.I.A. is a woman; there is Comdr. Roberta Peach (Peach? honestly) of the Navy; Ryan's wife receives a Lasker Award for her breakthroughs in ophthalmic surgery; one of the C.I.A. assassins is informed, practically in the middle of dispatching slanty-eyed despoilers of American women, that his own daughter has made dean's list and will probably get into medical school; secretaries, we are told again and again, are the real heroes, etc., etc.",Megabashing Japan,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/books/crime-mystery-megabashing-japan.html

EMANUEL AX Further varying his Brahms and Schoenberg series, Mr. Ax relinquishes the spotlight to play chamber music with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the exceptional young violinist Pamela Frank, the clarinetist Paul Meyer, and the television commentator and sometime flutist Eugenia Zukerman. Jan. 18, Carnegie Hall. WILLIAM BOLCOM For its third annual Composer Week, the New York Philharmonic goes American, with a Pulitzer Prize winner, whose music runs the gamut from pop to atonalism. It's a pity the orchestra is not presenting his grand eclectic compendium, ""Songs of Innocence and Experience,"" but the Fifth Symphony and ""Commedia"" cover ample ground. Leonard Slatkin conducts. Jan. 19, Avery Fisher Hall. ""WINTERREISE"" This wrenching cycle of lost love demands both a great singer and a sensitive accompanist. The combination of the venerable tenor Peter Schreier and the young pianist Alexei Lubimov seems promising. Jan. 20, Carnegie Hall. ""SIMON BOLIVAR"" We've already had Nixon and Mao on the opera stage; now Thea Musgrave looks for music in the life of this Latin American liberator. Jan. 20, Virginia Opera. (804-623-1223) FOCUS 1995 The Juilliard School's annual Focus festival appears to have more focus than usual this season, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Anton Webern's death by playing nearly all his works and music by composers he inspired. Jan. 20-27, Alice Tully Hall and the Juilliard Theater. ANONYMOUS 4 This sublimely blended female quartet brought early polyphony to the Billboard charts long before the Gregorian chant vogue turned the clock back even further. Here the no longer anonymous four sing music from the Codex Calixtinus, compiled around 1140. Jan. 22, Corpus Christi Church. YEVGENY KISSIN Not to rush things, but now that this young Russian firebrand has proved himself in finger-breaking dazzlers, it's time he lets us hear what he can do with heftier scores. Here he tackles sonatas by Beethoven and Haydn, and Brahms's ""Paganini"" Variations. Jan. 23, Carnegie Hall. URSULA OPPENS AND FREDERIC RZEWSKI Ms. Oppens has long been a great interpreter of Mr. Rzewski's searing political music. In their debut as a piano duo, they play a new Rzewski work and a transcription of Beethoven's ""Grosse Fuge."" Jan. 25, Miller Theater. CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Christoph von Dohnanyi and his splendid troops accompany Emanuel Ax in both Brahms piano concertos and perform Schoenberg's orchestration of the Brahms G-minor Piano Quartet. They also offer a concert version of Berg's ""Wozzeck."" Jan. 25-28, Carnegie Hall. CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF At 28, this German violinist may seem young to commit Bach's solo sonatas and partitas to disk, but a Mostly Mozart performance of Bach over the summer left little doubt that he has the needed maturity. (Virgin/EMI) February BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC Bach's works are said to be almost infinitely adaptable. Here, in ""Bach to Bach,"" they are refracted through the sensibilities of Schumann, Mendelssohn, Lukas Foss and Peter Schickele in a Brooklyn Philharmonic program, a good test of how far they can be stretched. Feb. 3, Brooklyn Academy of Music. JARD VAN NES Mezzo-sopranos dominated the list of pleasant surprises at vocal recitals last season. Jard van Nes, of the Netherlands, who has pleased on disk and as a soloist, makes her New York recital debut with Schumann's ""Frauenliebe und Leben."" Feb. 5, Frick Collection. ""HERODIADE"" Strauss's ""Salome"" gets all the attention, but Massenet's 1881 operatic portrayal of Herod, Herodias, Salome and John the Baptist is just as vivid and notably more lyrical. Eve Queler and her Opera Orchestra of New York present the work in concert with Renee Fleming, Grace Bumbry and Yuri Mazurok. Feb. 14, Carnegie Hall. MENDELSSOHN STRING QUARTET Janacek's ""Intimate Letters,"" Smetana's ""From My Life"" and Berg's ""Lyric Suite"" tell of their composers' lives and loves, either openly or in posthumously deciphered code. Even without the thematic connection, they make a fine program, which should be in safe hands here. Feb. 21, Merkin Concert Hall. MICHAEL CHANCE One of the new breed of expressive countertenors, Mr. Chance has enlivened several early-opera recordings in recent years. In his New York recital debut, he sings works by Monteverdi, Strozzi and Purcell. Feb. 26, Frick Collection. ""INVISIBLE CITY OF KITEZH"" Valery Gergiyev, the artistic director of the Kirov Opera, has become a hot property on international podiums, but his most impressive achievement has been to maintain the company's reputation for vividly sung, beautifully staged productions. Rimsky-Korsakov's conflation of folklore and religion is not likely to have a more authoritative reading hereabout soon. Feb. 27, Brooklyn Academy of Music. ""THE FAERIE QUEEN"" Roger Norrington's new recording of this masque shapes up as one of the more interesting contributions to the Purcell tercentenary. (EMI) March KATHLEEN BATTLE AND THOMAS HAMPSON With two of the opera world's biggest egos and most appealing voices crowded onto a single stage, this could be a glorious collaboration or a slugfest hiding behind smiley faces, or both. March 1, Avery Fisher Hall. VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Sir Georg Solti steers one of the world's luxury orchestras down the middle of the symphonic mainstream: Beethoven's Seventh, Tchaikovsky's Sixth, Stravinsky's ""Petrouchka"" and works by Strauss and Wagner. With ticket prices topping out at $135, these guys (yes, to a man) are not taking risks. March 3-5, Carnegie Hall. JULIANNE BAIRD An exceptionally communicative early-music soprano sings theater songs and arias by Purcell, Handel and Arne with the Concert Royal period-instrument ensemble. March 7, Merkin Concert Hall. AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Obscurity is often both just and kind, but Leon Botstein enjoys trolling for history's innocent victims in the annual series ""Unjust Obscurity."" This installment includes works by Szymanowski, Mendelssohn, Othmar Schoeck and Roger Sessions. March 10, Avery Fisher Hall. AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA John Corigliano's 1976 ""Poem on His Birthday"" may be the lyrical drawing card here, but David Sampson's ""Triptych,"" for trumpet and orchestra, offers both long-lined, bluesy melodies and virtuoso fireworks -- material perfectly suited to the technique of the soloist, Raymond Mase. March 12, Carnegie Hall. ""LA TRAVIATA"" The New York City Opera quickly abandoned its updating of Verdi's ""Traviata,"" with the AIDS-ward ending. This new production, by Renata Scotto, will be more traditional. March 16, New York State Theater. ARCADIAN ACADEMY Poetry readings, lectures on the history, art, theater and architecture of 17th-century England, and performances by Nicholas McGegan and his academy should make for a stimulating two-day immersion in Henry Purcell's milieu on the occasion of his tercentenary. March 17-18, Metropolitan Museum. NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Sir Colin Davis, a masterly Sibelius conductor who visits New York too rarely, leads the Sixth and Seventh Symphonies, ""Tapiola"" and ""Pohjola's Daughter."" March 23, Avery Fisher Hall. ""PELLEAS ET MELISANDE"" Frederica von Stade, Marilyn Horne and Dwayne Croft star in Jonathan Miller's new production of Debussy's opera, which seems to be popping up everywhere nowadays. March 23, Metropolitan Opera House. ANDRAS SCHIFF The musicality of this Hungarian pianist has deepened over the years. Giving a twist to the usual three B's, he plays works by Bach, Beethoven and Bartok. March 24, Carnegie Hall. MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH Cello recitals by this Russian master have been lamentably rare since he began conducting, but his concerto performances have shown that his tone and command are undiminished. March 26, Avery Fisher Hall. ""THE MERRY WIDOW"" Just when you thought the New York City Opera's days of producing froth were behind it, here comes a new production of Lehar's glutinous crowd pleaser. March 26, New York State Theater. April ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA OF AMSTERDAM Riccardo Chailly may lack the insight of his predecessor, Bernard Haitink, but this Dutch orchestra has played with warmth and vitality under all kinds of conductors. April 2-3, Carnegie Hall. ""THE GHOSTS OF VERSAILLES"" The extravagant fantasy by John Corigliano and William Hoffmann, a hit in its premiere run three seasons ago, returns. James Levine conducts much of the original cast, including Teresa Stratas, Marilyn Horne and Gino Quilico. April 3, Metropolitan Opera House. ""HARVEY MILK"" It is a short leap from the front page to the opera stage these days. Stewart Wallace and Michael Korie trace the career of San Francisco's first openly gay politician, who was assassinated in 1978. This work was commissioned by the New York City Opera with the Houston Grand Opera (which gives the world premiere on Jan. 21) and the San Francisco Opera. April 4, New York State Theater. ELLY AMELING The Dutch soprano, renowned for her masterly way with art songs, is retiring from the stage at 57. She sings a farewell recital with her longtime accompanist, Rudolf Jansen. April 9, Alice Tully Hall. ALFRED BRENDEL The philosophical pianist's Beethoven recitals last season were truly illuminating. Here he offers nine sonatas in two concerts. April 10 and 17, Carnegie Hall. NEW WORLD SYMPHONY Michael Tilson Thomas, who has worked wonders with the young musicians in this training orchestra, will conduct his own ""Diary of Anne Frank"" and Mahler's First Symphony. April 28, Avery Fisher Hall. NEW YORK CONCERT SINGERS Because his escape from Italy in 1939 took him to Hollywood and because he never abandoned his bittersweet Romantic lyricism, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco became a 20th-century footnote. This program will appeal that judgment. April 30, Merkin Concert Hall. AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA The music of Chen Yi, whose Symphony No. 2 is played here, strikes a graceful balance between exotic Chinese folk elements and Western formal complexity. April 30, Carnegie Hall. ELIOT FISK The high-octane guitarist records Luciano Berio's ""Sequenza XI"" and other Italian works in ""Bell' Italia."" (Musicmasters) May ""SYMPHONY OF A THOUSAND"" To close Carnegie Hall's two-year Mahler cycle, Robert Shaw leads the Cleveland Orchestra and a balconyful of choristers in the Eighth Symphony. The prospects: transcendent insights at best, a sonic spectacular at least. May 4-5, Carnegie Hall. (Claudio Abbado's recording of the work with the Berlin Philharmonic is also due this month from Deutsche Grammophon.) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER Is the early-20th-century affinity between classical music and jazz news to anyone? The Chamber Music Society covers the ground again, with a new work by Wynton Marsalis and oldies from the usual suspects, Ravel, Gershwin, Stravinsky and Joplin. May 7, Alice Tully Hall. ""CABILDO"" Amy Beach may have been a derivative composer, but she had the field to herself among American women at the turn of the century. Perhaps a performance of her 1932 opera, led by Ransom Wilson, will reveal a spark of originality. May 13, Alice Tully Hall. DMITRI KHVOROSTOVSKY AND OLGA BORODINA Two of the most admired, most powerfully endowed opera stars to come out of the former Soviet Union will sing arias and duets, mostly from Russian opera, with Eve Queler and the Opera Orchestra of New York.

Twelve-year-old Peejoe has a lot to handle in the summer of 1965: his aunt has just beheaded his uncle and lit out for Hollywood, and the civil rights movement is disturbing the complacency of his Southern town.

A month ago, The City surveyed Manhattan, interviewing dozens of residents, merchants, police officers and district managers of community boards to seek examples of quality of life issues. A journey through Queens reveals similar psychic desires, for order, cleanliness and a nonviolent environment. But the decidedly unscientific survey shows some different emphases, in some cases reflecting immigration -- overcrowded houses, and auto shops turning up on residential blocks. In addition, livery cabs triple-parked outside their bases are grating nerves. Illegal dumping is prevalent. East Queens, partly suburban, has beefs, but the west can list more. Soon, The City will look at Brooklyn and The Bronx. ASTORIA HEIGHTS, ASTORIA LONG ISLAND CITY 1. AIRPLANE NOISE Especially heavy in bad weather when incoming-flight path over Astoria Heights is used more. 2. NOISE Comes from heavy traffic from trucks headed to Triborough Bridge. 3. AUTO THEFTS AND BREAK-INS A major concern. Many residents have taken radios out of their cars. 4. ILLEGAL DUMPING The lot under the Hell Gate Bridge, like most deserted areas, is a dumping spot. 5. HOMELESS ENCLAVES Homeless people congregate, and live in, parks under the Triborough Bridge, making families in area uneasy. There are sanitation problems, too. 6-7. LIVERY CABS On Steinway Street and 23d Avenue and Broadway and 37th Street, livery cabs double-park and triple-park, tying up traffic and blocking access to sidewalks and crosswalks. 8. GRAFFITI Buildings along the 31st Street elevated subway tracks -- from Ditmars Boulevard to Queens Plaza -- are covered with bright-colored graffiti, although a cleanup program involving youthful offenders is having an effect. 9. PROSTITUTION Streetwalkers congregate in the area around Jackson Avenue and 23d Street. 10-12. ILLEGAL DUMPING In July, a trailer was found with tons of rancid meat at (10) 48th Street and Barnett Avenue. Other dumping spots include (11) Skillman Avenue from 35th to 39th Street and (12) the Queens-Midtown Expressway from 42d to 48th Street. 13. WINDOW WASHERS A persistent problem at 31st Street and Bridge Plaza North and South, although enforcement efforts are thinning the ranks. 14. NOISE Loiterers play loud radios at 43d Avenue and 43d Street. 15. EYESORES At Greenpoint Avenue near Queens Boulevard merchants display their wares too far into the sidewalk.

Other flashbacks had been planned, as Joe Cocker, the reconstituted Band and Crosby, Stills and Nash (minus Neil Young) performed at their second Woodstock festival. This time, Crosby, Stills and Nash got to sing their hit ""Woodstock,"" which Joni Mitchell wrote after the 1969 festival. When Mr. Cocker sang ""With a Little Help from My Friends,"" hundreds of thousands of arms waved and swayed in the air, and everyone seemed to be singing along, in a tribute to 1969 as heartfelt as it was predictable. Later, the Band (without its main songwriters, Robbie Robertson and the late Richard Manuel) juxtaposed songs from ""Music from Big Pink,"" composed in Saugerties, with more recently recorded material. Other 1960's figures sat in with the Band, including Roger McGuinn of the Byrds and more Woodstock alumni: Hot Tuna (the guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady, who were with the Jefferson Airplane) and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead.",Familiar Voices and Familiar Themes,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/nyregion/woodstock-94-the-music-familiar-voices-and-familiar-themes.html

He added: ""They are handwritten capitulations. Instead of 'No Radio' we need new signs that say 'No Surrender.' "" IT may be the political mantra of the year. But what does it mean? What exactly are we worried about? In a decidedly unscientific attempt to answer these questions, The City asked dozens of Manhattanites -- police officers, local officials, community workers and men and women on the street -- what they saw as the quality-of-life issues in their neighborhoods. Their answers show remarkable differences, remarkable similarities. Nor is the picture they offer all gloom and doom. What follows is a selection of their responses -- an impressionistic map, if you will, of what we think ails us. In the coming weeks, The City will take the measure of neighborhoods in the other boroughs. UPPER MANHATTAN 1. TRAFFIC Congestion, noise and litter, especially on Seaman Avenue, as drivers avoid paying the recently increased toll on the Henry Hudson Bridge. 2. DRUGS Though police enforcement has thinned the ranks of street dealers, problems continue at two intersections in Inwood -- Thayer and Vermillion and Sherman and Dyckman. 3. CAR RADIOS Throughout Washington Heights, the big-boom radios have proliferated. In response, the police are conducting sweeps, ticketing drivers and seizing cars. 4. STREET DRINKING A problem throughout Washington Heights. A hot spot: around George Washington High, 193d and Audubon, especially when school is in session. 5. UNLICENSED VENDORS Near the entrances to the George Washington Bridge, unlicensed vendors sell everything from cellular phones to stuffed animals. Also, window washers and panhandlers pose a problem on 178th Street. 6. DRUGS Street sales at 159th Street and Broadway. Drug supermarket in building at 540 West 165th Street, near Amsterdam Avenue. 7. SEWAGE PLANT The North River plant, at 145th Street and the Hudson, is a frequent source of complaints about foul odors and respiratory problems. 8. UNLICENSED VENDORS In Hamilton Heights, in the West 150's, vendors selling homemade food and other items are heavily patronized by drug dealers. 9. RATS On and around Lenox Avenue from 110th Street north. 10. VACANT LOTS These lots attract the illegal dumping of abandoned cars and other garbage. The cars, in turn, attract drug trafficking, while the refuse attracts rats. Hot spots: 126th Street between Eighth and St. Nicholas Avenues; 117th Street and Eighth Avenue. 11. DRUGS Two of the biggest drug bazaars in East Harlem: 110th Street and Lexington Avenue and 119th Street and Second Avenue. 12. PROSTITUTION Women, many of them crack addicts, solicit passing motorists under the Park Avenue elevated tracks. 13. VACANT LOTS At 105th Street and First Avenue, an empty lot has become a heroin-trafficking site and a garbage dump. Unlicensed vendors have taken over another lot at 127th Street and Second Avenue. 14. PANHANDLING Though window washers have become less of a problem, beggars tie up traffic at the 125th Street entrance to the Triborough Bridge. UPPER WEST SIDE 1. CAR BREAK-INS A frequent complaint in Morningside Heights, especially along Morningside and Riverside Drives. 2. TRAFFIC Riverside Drive from 110th Street north is used by city buses as a layover zone; the generally quiet Clermont Avenue is used as a bus route and a stopover for drivers. 3. VACANT LOTS Garbage is dumped in vacant lots east of Amsterdam Avenue from 96th to 110th Street, and especially in front of the old Towers Nursing Home at 106th Street and Central Park West. 4. SOCIAL-SERVICE PROGRAMS The area between 96th and 101st Streets, largely on Broadway, has roughly a half-dozen hotels for the formerly homeless and former mental patients. Many are drug users, say the police, who add that the Midway and the Marion Hotels have presented the largest problems. 5. DRUGS Crack sales along Broadway, near the hotels, and along Amsterdam Avenue from 86th to 96th Streets. Hot spots: for crack, 87th and Amsterdam; for marijuana, 94th and West End. 6. PROSTITUTION Streetwalkers congregate on Broadway and West End Avenue in the upper 80's and lower 90's. Over the last year, the police say, a crackdown has lessened the problem markedly. 7. PANHANDLING All along Broadway, from 72d Street to 116th Street. 8. POSTING BILLS All over the Upper West Side, notices are posted on telephone poles, bus shelters and lampposts. MIDTOWN 1. TRAFFIC Continued closing of the 48th Street ramp to the F.D.R. Drive causes rush-hour congestion of First Avenue. Diplomatic occasions frequently snarl traffic near the United Nations. 2. HOMELESS ENCLAVE An encampment has sprung up around First Avenue in the lower 40's, concentrated in Tudor City Park. 3. DOGS More specifically, their owners' failure to pick up after them. 4. DRUGS Sales along Eighth and Ninth Avenues, 34th to 57th Street. 5. HOMELESS ENCLAVES The encampment in Columbus Circle is gone, but enclaves exist in DeWitt Clinton Park, on 11th Avenue between 52d and 54th Streets, and in Sheffield Plaza, 57th Street and Ninth Avenue. 6. GARBAGE In front of restaurants on Eighth Avenue between 53d and 57th Streets. THE VILLAGES 1. PROBLEM PARKS Several West Village parks -- Bleecker (Bleecker Street from 11th to Bank), Jackson Square (Eighth Avenue between 13th and Horatio) and Washington Square -- are the focus of complaints about drug dealers, homeless encampments and other problems. 2. PUBLIC DRINKING Though a police crackdown has reduced drinking and rowdiness around Eighth Street, this remains a dominant complaint throughout the Village, especially on Christopher Street, Bleecker Street, 14th Street and Avenue of the Americas. 3. STOLEN GOODS MARKET Locals call it ""Thieves R Us,"" a market that appears at about 10 o'clock nightly, with everything from computers to leather coats sold from car trunks. 4. SANITATION POLICE On Second Avenue, from Sixth to 12th Street, merchants complain of being ticketed for trash they say they did not produce. 5. WINDOW WASHERS Along Houston Street. 6. UNLICENSED VENDORS Along Broadway from Eighth Street to Houston, peddlers, many of them unlicensed, compete with merchants. Also, along 14th Street, from Avenue of the Americas to University Place. 7. DRUGS Street sales, mostly of crack, on the southeast corner of 14th Street and Third Avenue. The Regina Hotel, an S.R.O. at 13th and Third, also attracts drug dealers and prostitutes. UPPER EAST SIDE 1. CAR THEFT The biggest problem in the area, says Nancy Wackstein, the executive director of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House; according to the police, the Upper East Side has among the highest rates of car theft and break-ins in the city. 2. PARKING Or the lack thereof, especially because of the number of places reserved for diplomatic parking. 3. PANHANDLING Along Madison Avenue. The expensive shops draw the well-to-do, who, in turn, draw the beggars. 4. HOMELESS ENCLAVES People sleep in Carl Schurz and John Jay Parks, along the East River, as well as on the benches along Fifth Avenue, in the wake of the 1 A.M. curfew in Central Park. 5. TRAFFIC Construction at New York Hospital and along York Avenue has brought congestion on York, First and Second Avenues. 6. NIGHTCLUB NOISE Bars and restaurants along First and Second Avenues in the 80's draw frequent complaints of noise and rowdiness. 7. ROBBERIES OF CHILDREN Many people complain that older children steal their children's money and other items. (The police say, however, that while there have been some robberies, they are not a major problem.) CHELSEA/GRAMERCY 1. HOMELESS ENCLAVE Homeless people and drug dealing have pushed children and their parents out of most of Phipps Plaza and Bellevue South Park, between First and Second Avenues, 27th to 29th Street. 2. STOLEN SIGNS On Fifth Avenue from 14th to 20th Street, drivers steal ""No Parking"" and ""No Standing"" signs to avoid being ticketed. 3. HOMELESS ENCLAVES Scaffolding at Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, has become a home for street people. Also, with a curfew periodically enforced, the homeless sometimes sleep in Union Square Park. 4. DRUGS Sales in buildings on 17th Street, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. 5. PROSTITUTION Street solicitation, along Madison Avenue and Park Avenue South, 27th to 29th Street. 6. TRUCKS Trucks trying to avoid 14th Street traffic use 13th and 15th Streets, from the Hudson to Union Square, causing noise and congestion on these side streets. LOWER MANHATTAN 1. UNLICENSED CAFES Throughout SoHo, many restaurants have opened sidewalk cafes, many of them without licenses. 2. STREET VENDORS Throughout SoHo, especially street artists, booksellers and food vendors. 3. GRAFFITI Throughout TriBeCa. A hot spot: Broadway, just north of Chambers Street, where residents now mount a weekly cleaning detail. 4. STREET VENDORS Along Canal Street, and especially from Avenue of the Americas to Broadway, where car-stereo dealers spread out onto the sidewalks. Also in Chinatown, where fish and vegetable stores spill out of doors. 5. MOTORCYCLE NOISE Along Mercer Street and Broadway up to Eighth Street, groups of bikers who have remove the baffling inside their mufflers. 6. STREET VENDORS In the financial district, but especially along Wall Street. 7. BUILDING MAINTENANCE In the housing projects of the Lower East Side -- Seward Park, La Guardia, Rutgers and Alfred E. Smith -- residents tell of broken elevators, unreliable heating and the like. They also complain of drug dealing and muggings. 8. IN-LINE SKATERS On the Promenade at Battery Park City.",What Makes Us Angry,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/nyregion/what-makes-us-angry.html

The indictment, returned Feb. 24 by a Federal grand jury, had been sealed pending the arrest of the suspects, who live in Minnesota and California. The men are charged with conspiring to import and distribute about seven and a half tons of marijuana and multiple kilograms of cocaine from 1988 to 1993. United States Attorney DAVID LILLEHAUG said the alleged smuggling operation stretched from Colombia to California to St. Paul and Mankato, Minn. The indictment charges McCarthy, who played for the the North Stars in the 1981 Stanley Cup finals, with conspiring to distribute cocaine and marijuana. He was arrested Friday and released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years to life in prison and a $4 million fine.

Intoxication is a refrain, and so is sexuality, a combination that offers a broadened perspective on the sober minds so diligently at work in the rest of the book. Unlike the women in the other stories, those in ""Batorsag and Szerelem"" are given full, lively presences. The stubborn domesticity of Clive's mother, for example, turns out to have masked, all along, her knowledge that Clive's girlfriend, Sandra, has been living just below her kitchen, hiding in the basement furnace room.

BEFORE THE BENCH The Road to Arraignment An arraignment is a hearing in which a defendant generally enters a plea and bail is set. Here is why it takes a full 24 hours to get the job done in Manhattan. THE ARREST -- Defendants are taken to the nearest precinct for paperwork, then booked ot One Police Plaza in lower Manhattan and put in holding pens. THE PAPERWORK -- Complaint sheets, with statements by witnesses and arresting officers, are filed out. Evaluations for bail, with a report ona defendant's community roots, are prepared. Fingerprints are sent to Albany: the biggest delay is waiting for the print report, or rap sheet, to be sent back. All papers are collated and distributed to the lawyers. THE PROSECUTOR -- The assistant district attorney, based at the criminal court building at 100 Centre Street, meets with arresting officers and makes decisions about how to charge a case - for example, as a trespass (misdemeanor) or a burglary (felony) - and what bail to request. THE DEFENSE LAWYER -- After being moved to holding pens at 100 Centre Street, defendants meet with lawyers, usually just before the arraignment.",His Night in Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/making-it-work-his-night-in-court.html
