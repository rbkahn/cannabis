A1 How closely the President has tied has chances for achievement in his last 13 months in office to the Soviet leader is reflected in the summit meeting, according to political experts. A19 Raisa Gorbachev was asked by a reporter during a tour of the White House whether she'd like to live there. She replied, ''A human being would like to live in a regular home. This is a museum.''

A28 Taxpayers have three weeks left to take advantage of a wide variety of strategies that will make next April 15 less costly, including prepaying some expenses and picking the best time to sell investments. A1 Stock prices surged higher for a third consecutive day, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 34.15 points, to close at 1,902.52, but many traders remain wary of what they think may be a short-lived rally.

Yet it's not too late to formulate a battle plan, and the starting point is to distinguish the issues posed by each drug. Marijuana. Disrupting the foreign-grown supply only drives up the price for domestic product. The Ginsburg incident demonstrates anew the wide tolerance of behavior still classified as illegal. The drug may have adverse effects on the user, but they are on a par with those of tobacco and alcohol. They don't warrant outlawing marijuana so much as discouraging excessive use. Rather than saddle law enforcement with the task of suppressing pot, authorities could frankly acknowledge the wisdom of decriminalizing it. Possession of an ounce or less has already been reduced to a ticketable offense in 11 states. Cocaine. Since cocaine is hard to grow domestically, diplomatic efforts to reduce the foreign crop make sense. An aerial spray would be a major advance; tearing up coca bushes by the roots is labor intensive and invites violent confrontation with farmers. At home, meanwhile, police are developing new tactics against street-level drug processing and selling. These could be expanded and emulated. Heroin. Treatment offers the most obvious benefit. Most addicts eventually tire of their habit; all who do ought to be granted immediate help. That includes the option of using methadone, a drug that blocks heroin craving while permitting the addict to lead a normal life. Much might be done to expand treatment rapidly just by easing requirements that dispensing of methadone be accompanied by heavy counseling and other social services.",President Reagan's Drug Bust,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/13/opinion/president-reagan-s-drug-bust.html

What's more, Ms. Lansbury sets about the novel by way of exaggeration, set funny pieces and caricature, which should be a recipe for disaster, for a wince a page, but such is the power of her wit and energy that it isn't: it's a laugh a page, a delight a page, and even when it's a discreet rape a page, the overall feeling is, simply, of joy; which breaks down into relish in the absurdity of our human condition (and the higher our I.Q., it seems, the more absurd we are), into pleasure in our aspirations and gratitude for the sensual delights that make the lives even of academics worth living.",A SLATTERN AND A SCHOLAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/books/a-slattern-and-a-scholar.html

Settling down is what Robert, the 35-year-old hero of the sourly sentimental book by George Furth, cannot do; instead of keeping company with a nice girl, he hangs around with five married couples, who have him in to dinner and worry over whether he's going out enough.",Theater: A Revival of 'Company',https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/theater/theater-a-revival-of-company.html

When he gets a chance at a song, like the cute ''Barcelona,'' with Donna English as the funny dumb stewardess, he proves there's a personality behind the laid-back yuppie persona. And when, at the conclusion, he gives out with ''Being Alive,'' you get a belated inkling of what the show was meant to be about. Other big solos come from Liz Larsen, who belts the exciting ''Another Hundred People,'' and Barbara Andres, as the hard-boiled drinker first played by Elaine Stritch, doing the pathetic-sardonic ''The Ladies Who Lunch.'' (''When they get depressed, it's a bottle of scotch plus a little jest.'') Miss Andres's role, though familiar and overdrawn, is at least defined. The other couples are skit figures, brought on to get a laugh or make a point. Sometimes they are amusing - Jeanne Lehman trying marijuana for the first time and Judith Blazer suffering the shakes on her wedding day have the juiciest scenes; sometimes they are just annoying Manhattanites straight out of the life style pages, with sociological tags attached. The only time you care about them is when they deliver a Sondheim song - which, it must be emphasized, is a lot of the time. The songs make better company than the characters.

Widening his angle of vision, the writer shows us that drink, dope and sex are merely incidental influ-ences on the party night in progress. Walter and his mates are in Peterskill, N.Y., an hour up the Taconic from Manhattan, not on the Coast or Mexico-bound. When midnight deviltry dumps them into the Hudson, swimming for the moorings of a fleet of mothballed merchantmen, the sounds of their roistering commingle with eerie murmurs. On the deck of the U.S.S. Anima, a rusted hulk, Walter Van Brunt catches sight of the ghost of a vanished elder amidst a crowd of ''ragged, red-eyed, drooling'' bums. ('' 'America for Americans!' Walter's father shouted, and the phantom crowd took it up with a gibber and wheeze that wound down finally to a crazed muttering in the dark.'') A minute later, the novelist directs our attention away from the roisterers, sending us back three centuries to a ''five-morgen farm'' close to a Hudson River trading post, the turf on which Walter's ancestors (a father, a mother, three children) began their American life. Hollanders indentured ''for all their days on earth,'' the family is obligated to pay the patroon, within six months of their landing, ''five hundred guilders in rent, two fathoms of firewood (split, delivered and reverently stacked in the cavernous woodshed at the upper manor house), two bushels of wheat, two pair of fowl, and twenty-five pounds of butter.''",GHOST SHIPS ON THE HUDSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/books/ghost-ships-on-the-hudson.html

She looked up the river to where the mountains fell away in continents of shadow and seagulls hung in oceans of filtered light. Above that, and around the bend, he told her, it's a clear channel up to West Point. Then we hit Martyr's Reach.

In four works of fiction published between 1979 and 1985 T. Coraghessan Boyle showed himself to be lively and language-intoxicated - but determinedly disengaged. There were two volumes of short stories that were long on black comedy and included a number of pieces that originated seemingly as funny bits or turns - games of which the grandmasters are S. J. Perelman and Terry Southern. (The premise of one story: What if a scientist doing language research with primates fell in love with a chimp?) There was a novel - ''Budding Prospects'' (1984) - on marijuana farming in California's Mendocino County; its self-teasing began with the title and subtitle (''A Pastoral''), the dedication (''This book is for my horticultural friends''), and the epigraph (Ben Franklin: ''Plough deep, while Sluggards sleep, and you shall have Corn to sell and to keep''), and continued to the closing page. There was a picaresque lark - ''Water Music'' (1981) - a retelling of the African adventures of the 18th-century explorer Mungo Park that was packed with comic conceits. (Example: shoe-blacked herring and frogs' eggs peddled as caviar under the trade name Chichikov's Choice.) Writers of stature - Robert Coover and William Gass among them - praised Mr. Boyle's work. Here and there a story that began as a comic bit would seem to grow restive, as though assailed momentarily by a hunger for seriousness. (One such story - ''Caviar'' -was awarded a Pushcart Press prize in 1977.)

Black comedy and literary allusion erupt occasionally in the presentation of Van Brunt, who in 1968 is an accident-prone college dropout with a 4-F deferment. (Walter's first collision with history - he bangs into a historical marker while cavorting on his Norton - costs him half a leg; we're told often that his avowed hero is Meursault, Camus's famous nihilist.) Traces of the ungenerosity toward bottom dog dreamers and others that blemishes some of the author's shorter fiction also surface in ''World's End.'' (The mockery, in Mr. Boyle's story ''Greasy Lake,'' of those for whom Bruce Springsteen became a spokesman enters this novel in an account of a rock concert at Vassar College.) But belief in human range and possibility is stronger here than in any of Mr. Boyle's previous books, and it generates a dozen or more characters - Indians, merchants, hippie idealists, others -sufficiently various to experience complex reactions and stimulate them in readers. Even young Walter himself - undisciplined, half-educated -has a grainy nature. He can distinguish ''mindless, brick-throwing racist [ s ] '' from people mildly infected with Bircherism, and he possesses, in addition, a strong imagination of guilt. He's tormented by the version of his father as traitor that's come down to him, through his mother and other relatives - partisans of the Socialist Left who are convinced that his father colluded with the moneyed Van Warts to set them at the mercy of the anti-Communist mob during the riots. (A substantial portion of the narrative follows Walter's struggle to find his father and to penetrate the mystery of his behavior.) It's not primarily the sense of character, though, that lies at the root of this book's distinction; it's the ceaseless reaching for broader contexts, more comprehensive views - the push for a vision of interrelationships, the obvious impatience with self-preoccupation. As ''World's End'' interweaves, fugally, the lives of long-gone peasants, slaves, landholders and displaced Indians with those of last season's activists, wantons, rentiers and factory hands, we're conscious of recurrences and echoes. Past and present, sharply separated by the chapter structure, are fused in motifs and unstressed parallels. The themes that emerge aren't riveting when stated abstractly. We knew before ''World's End'' that, in many ages, the powerful have done poorly at conjoining power with remorse, have been incapable either of seeing their opposition as other than rude, crude and lawless or of remembering the rude, crude, lawless acts by which their own ascendancy was gained. Neither is it news that, in many ages, the powerless, blinded by rage and uneducated into the complexity of things, have settled for stereotypes of their masters, asked impossible heroism of themselves and failed their best hopes.",GHOST SHIPS ON THE HUDSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/books/ghost-ships-on-the-hudson.html

We grasp in new terms their connection with the American social and political experiment. We see their pertinence to the succession of conflicts involving flimflammed Indians, manorial lords, spies, patriots, Stalinist provocateurs, enemies of ''the Communist-inspired, anti-American, long-haired hippie outrage.''

When religious commitments collapse, science deflates itself, and political illusions are universally seen through, history may well be the only call anybody's spirit can heed, the only resource left for slaking our hunger for seriousness.

''You expect too much,'' she tells him, unable to cope with his desperate need. It's Ellery who quotes him Sylvia Plath. Ellery has her own problems - hating herself, trying to forgive her mother Ginny's flight to these backwoods from a safe suburban marriage. Ginny remembers the suburbs as an outsider, with cliches of frenetic cocktail parties and shallow fashion, and the picture of her isolation in suburban affluence lacks the painful authenticity of Coralee's fear in the kitchen shadows.

Within, on the marble-inlaid floor, Abel Tasman's most recent discoveries in the antipodes are conspicuously named ''New Holland,'' while the Netherlands itself is placed at the Jerusalem-like center of the mappa mundi.

Yet his erudite and engrossing study far transcends the interests of only Dutch, or art, historians. It is a fascinating panorama as busily animated and skillfully composed as scenes by Hendrick Avercamp or Jan Steen (whose ''Fat Kitchen'' and ''Thin Kitchen,'' along with scores of other pic-tures in the book by many artists, speak to Mr. Schama's argument). Such is the enthusiasm and dramatic verve that allow Mr. Schama to cross and crisscross, through multiple the overlapping essays, his themes of Dutch moral and household economy. For Dutch wealth and conspicuous consumption are his concern, matched by all the uncertain restraints of Calvinist inhibition and shame. His is a quasi-anthropological attempt to describe historical behavior as social process, not so much by analyses of institutions or theology or the arts as by a compilation of the mental bric-a-brac composing what Emile Durkheim called ''the collective or common conscience'' of a culture.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

His opening sentence proclaims ''the peculiar genius of the Dutch to seem, at the same time, familiar and incomprehensible.'' I have myself heard the Dutch described as the Chinese of Europe. What animates their sense of community? What generates their allegiance? What crystallizes their manners? The Dutch, being bourgeois, are presumably whatever the modern mind calls bourgeois: prosaic, literal, frugal, reducing eternal mystery to commonplace commodity. Yet a Dutch burger, in his origin, is profoundly different from the ideological bourgeois. That is one theme of this book, paralleled by a second, which is the moral ambiguity of a culture whose economy, in two generations, dominated the world. Stupendous wealth was sucked into an alluvial delta containing a population of fewer than two million. Yet a similar ambiguity affects the Dutch state to this day. For the period after World War II saw a second Golden Age (typically, not admitted as such), glutting shops and homes, that haunts the public conscience with embarrassment, though not as intensely as in the 17th century perhaps. THE Dutch then, like their cultural descendants across the Atlantic, saw themselves as a peculiar people with a manifest destiny. For were they not survivors of the primal flood (the zondvloed) that had drowned the land? By reclaiming the land, they redeemed it. Theirs was the reiterated godlike role of separating the dry land from the wet by a defensive line of dikes and pumping windmills. From that line, too, sprang their communalist ethics. For only a common effort and common resources could hold back catastrophe. Their eternal war against the ocean was readily equated with their 80-year war against Spain, mingling Flood and Mosaic paradigms. Ordeal (or trial of faith) was followed by redemption and conspicuous prosperity (as sign of grace). Such was their epic, creating a Calvinist ''moral geography'' (in Mr. Schama's phrase), or, as Americans might say, a frontier consciousness. Grace had marked them as members of an elect - reincarnated children of Israel who had entered a new Canaan.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

But it was the very making of the Dutch polity. Theirs was a new covenant of liberty. The Netherlands was an Israel delivered from the idolatry and bondage of a Spanish Sennacherib or Pharaoh; William the Silent, on the same model, was a new lion of Judah. Yet questions remained to harass this New Israel, questions still echoing in this nuclear age: How to be strong yet pure; how to be rich yet humble; how to avert the calamity of uncontrolled luxury. For soon, in their fine ruffs, Dutch burghers were choking on Ming porcelain, Anatolian carpets, Lyons silk, Venetian mirrors, Japanese lacquerware, Brazilian emeralds, East Indian sapphires, oriental spices, exotic Turkish tulips, blue and white faience, Delft tiles, dazzling white Haarlem linen and, above all, to every visitor's surprise, hundreds of engravings and oil paintings hanging in even the most ordinary tradesmen's houses.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

The people were almost always depicted as big-boned and gross-bodied, guzzling and sozzling. But they were simply better fed than the rest of Europe. Diderot, in his ''Voyage de Hollande,'' was amazed to see workers in the towns and boers in the country routinely eating fresh and cured meat, fish, fresh vegetables, fruit, butter, eggs and cheese. In 1636 a ship with a crew of 100 carried for every month at sea: 450 pounds of cheese, five tons of meat, 400 pounds of cured fish, four tons of herring, one and a quarter tons of butter, five and a half tons of dried peas, two and a half tons of dried beans, half a ton of salt, half an oxhead of vinegar, 35 tuns of ale in winter (42 in summer) and French and Spanish wines for the officers.

Snuff, pipe shag and chewing tobacco created a squalid, nicotine-stained environment. One French traveler in the mid-18th century counted as many as 300 smokers in a single inn at Rotterdam. Genever, their favorite tipple, was brought by William III to England, to become the ruin (see Hogarth) of the working classes. The general idea was that the Dutch needed so much liquor to ward off the chilly vapors rising from their bogs and ditches. By the hostile British, however, it was simply called ''Dutch courage.'' There were pipe makers in most Dutch centers, but especially in Gouda. By 1700 the Amsterdam tobacco works had a turnover in the region of 12 million pounds, with exports to Russia, Prussia and the Levant. As Mr. Schama notes, the Hague and Amsterdam still boast the most resplendent cigar shops in the world.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

Drunken stupor, lethargy and drowsiness became a standard topos of much Dutch painting. All this was grist to the regulating morality of the Dutch Reformed Church. Tobacco, spirits, even Brazilian sugar, these were Satan's work. By the 1640's there were already more than 50 sugar refineries in Amsterdam. Today the Dutch still have a peculiarly sweet tooth, munching on waffles, pralines and pancakes - except that dental care is vastly improved. How then redeem the people from drowning in such lekkerheid? For the obsessive fear could only be expressed in this biblical vision of the deluge. The moral geography of the Netherlands demanded constant vigilance. Freedom and hydraulic engineering went hand in hand. Sometimes the dikes must be breached against the Spaniards (to raise the siege of Leiden in 1574) or against the advancing army of Louis XIV 100 years later. Sometimes the waterlinie collapsed of its own accord, inundating the land. Catastrophic floods in 1726 and 1728 were interpreted as signs of Sodom; and by 1731, when a massive length of dikes along the North Sea collapsed, drowning whole villages, a persecution of sodomites was under way, with more than 250 convictions and some 40 boys, youths and men strangled and drowned.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

A certain ceremonious and self-congratulatory liberalism, based on the family, is more in the Dutch line. Foreigners noted the odd spectacle of 17th-century couples freely caressing each other in public, just as elderly Dutch couples still promenade arm in arm. Households averaged only two children, where cleanliness, as all the world knows, was close to godliness; and a cleansing utensil was (and remains) a patriotic badge. It was no accident, Mr. Schama writes, that Adm. Maarten Tromp tacked a broom to the bowsprit of his flagship to sweep the seas of tyrants, pirates and papists.","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

Thus, too, the importance of laundry, of bleaching and clean sheets. But this may also have been accompanied by a comparatively greater marital and financial freedom for women. By 1742, 15 percent of all taxable enterprises in Amsterdam and 24 percent in Leiden were those of women. But, Mr. Schama adds: ''It also seems that the great majority of these incomes were those of widows rather than married women trading on their own. Indeed it is still the case that while the Netherlands has one of the oldest and richest traditions of modern feminism in Europe, it has one of the lowest percentages of mothers in the workforce.''","HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WORRIED TOO",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/books/healthy-wealthy-and-worried-too.html

Increasingly this industrial license was accompanied by a license in speech, religious toleration and wide-ranging curiosity. The sight of so much display must have stunk in others' nostrils. For the Dutch, as heirs of Burgundian Flanders, married a taste for opulence with their own traditions of civic pomp.

Until the 19th century there was no equestrian statue in the country; they are still most untypical. Heroic monumentality is simply un-Dutch. The schutterstukken or local militia groups -even at their most flamboyant as in the famous series by Frans Hals in Haarlem - are really ''group portraits of civilians in martial fancy dress.'' As Mr. Schama goes on to say: ''The marked unwillingness of the Dutch to allow the martial ethos status or dignity in its culture not only separated it from the absolute monarchies, where whims of knightly valor and godlike indestructibility could be entertained at court (and occasionally transformed from masque to policy). It also divorced the burgher Republic from the history of the Renaissance city-states with their appetite for internecine conflict.'' To this day the House of Orange, despite its royal titles, is closer in spirit to the old Stadholderate; it owes its legitimacy more to its ability to incarnate the will of the nation than in symbolic pretensions.

Such domestic content notoriously hobbled Dutch efforts at empire building. It seemed best to stay put, despite occasional unemployment and heavy taxes.

''Once Upon a Time,'' the first volume, covered the notorious custody suit brought, and won, by Aunt Gertrude against Mummy (Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt) - an action instigated, we are told in the foreword, by Grandmother Naney Morgan to keep Gloria in the United States with her family at a time when Mummy was considering marriage to a German prince. GLORIA sensed rather than understood other dark issues of the trial, but she knew all too well that it broke up for good her life-support system, her ''Caravan'' - the loving trio of Naney, Nurse Dodo and herself traveling around in her mother's wake. Partly because the child confused the lies she was supposed to tell the judge, Dodo was banished. To compound this cruelty, Mummy, or the Queen of Lace, or Lady Moon, as Gloria variously calls her, continued to avoid her daughter, either by absence or a complete lack of interest - though we are told that she repeatedly appealed the custody case. (In an epilogue, the author says, ''My mother too I have come to understand: she never really knew one single thing that ever happened to her, she always lived off someone else's smile.'') ''Black Knight, White Knght'' is really about Gloria's unending and futile attempt to wring approval from this glacial and insensitive creature. But nothing works - not pictures in Vogue, or lots of thrilling dates, not even husbands and children. Even the possibility of a screen test from Howard Hughes backfires because Mummy thought he was interested in her.","SUMMER READING;

Gloria doesn't dare disobey him. It's a weird transaction, and only half-described. AS Leopold grows ever colder and more distant, Gloria becomes increasingly ambitious. He's always encouraged her poetry and her painting. But he ignores her performance in ''The Swan'' by Molnar at a summer theater. Acting, he told her once, is only an interpretive art (like conducting). She should avoid Vanity Fair, and pray to ''Divine Mother'' when things go wrong. And do whatever he tells her. Poor-little-rich-girl stories abound, as do revelations by celebrity children of what goes on behind the castle walls. Ms. Vanderbilt's theme of a child seeking love from an unloving parent and then, somehow, marrying reflections of that parent has been told before.

Dowell freelanced as a model, socialized with photographers, actors, producers, and all the while coveted the fame and success that eluded him. When he turned his hand to writing fiction, it seemed to be with the hope that it might rescue him. His novels - among them ''One of the Children Is Crying,'' ''Mrs. October Was Here'' and ''Island People'' - brought him critical acclaim but no wider an audience, and after many years, Dowell forswore fiction.

The protagonist, looking for butter, ''found the coolly sweating crock at last in an icy room, a subcellar through which water rapidly and deeply coursed, a monstrously individual springhouse with labyrinths radiating long fluvial veins of impenetrable murk beneath the house and away, whence came the sighing sounds.

[when] the roots from which our bread was made were as afar and untouchable as stars, and the hunters came at nightfall with bone weariness and increased weakness their sole bag, we ate my sister's pet talking crow that could converse in long phrases like a man, and even parse a sentence. Although ate is hardly fitting for the feather sucking we children did.''",'DOWN THE THROAT OF NIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/down-the-throat-of-night.html

It ''made him drowsy but it also made him feel as if he was running a high temperature and was drunk on rock and rye, like the time he had whooping cough. Then, like now, his legs had seemed to be as big as houses. The things he looked at wavered like heat over asphalt. All the sounds of the day came to his ears twice.'' Because Dowell's prose style is, for better or for worse, impossible to ignore, it is sometimes difficult to apprehend his subjects and themes. Certainly the collection is about houses - the stories are suffused with references to them - houses as embodiments of all personal construction and endeavor: families, love affairs, marriages, works of art. In ''The Silver Swanne,'' the narrator's own ghost story, the house is a rambling seaside ''Toll House,'' a haunted mansion of a haunted soul. In ''Wool Tea'' the protagonist sees his own troubled house as ''an endless world like eternity that turned in on itself and spiraled around and around, some parts of it freezing and some parts of it burning and in some parts the possibility of great joy.'' In ''Writings on a Cave Wall'' the house is quite literally a cave, a grotto of grotesque, into which ''things [are] taken squirming and fighting in sacks.'' THIS story is Dowell's most explicit and pessimistic allegory of the scrivener's life, but throughout the collection the literary vocation figures prominently, in dark and disquieting tropes. The creative process seems, for Dowell, a kind of personal Gothic: children pursued, maidens estranged, men left tongueless, limbless, sleepless. Literary work becomes a construction of hidden staircases, secret chambers, a dwelling of cannibals, a house in which persons must die in order simply to leave. These are no casual stories. They are jagged and engulfed in shadow. And they often speak in a slightly mad metafiction, a struggled-for spookiness and dislocation, like that of children playing ghost games - a light held under the chin in the dark, a voice cryptic and surreal - as if desiring to unnerve especially themselves.",'DOWN THE THROAT OF NIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/books/down-the-throat-of-night.html

So, after the party, a bunch of us jumped outside and flagged the next available car, which happened to be a limo - the price was right - to take us down to Nell's.

Yet Janowitz has been published in the staid New Yorker and in the downtown journals Bomb, Between C & D and Top Stories. Chameleonlike, she projects both fast-track fame and downtown artiness, fitting everywhere and nowhere at once. ''In high school,'' she says, ''there were these cliques - the cheerleaders, the greasers, the ones with the motorcycles in the parking lot, the hippies smoking marijuana - all these little circles. I remember my mother telling me, 'You're not going to fit into any clique now, but in real life there aren't any cliques.'

Mona Simpson is a Paris Review editor whose impeccable literary connections include the Review's editor, George Plimpton, and her former teacher Elizabeth Hardwick. She compares the New York literary scene to George Eliot's Victorian community. ''It's like 'Middlemarch,' like you've entered a 19th-century novel,'' she says. ''I remember running into David Leavitt and Susan Minot at an Alice Munro reading. It was a rainy, miserable night and none of us wanted to be out, but we all turned up at this reading by one of our favorite writers. It gives you a sense of life as plot, having a large acquaintanceship. You catch up with people you haven't seen in a year, so someone will have had a baby or moved into a new apartment. You don't see the texture as much.

Charted, the connections might resemble a Faulknerian geneology; listed, they look like the stuff of a good soap opera. While in graduate school at Columbia, for instance, Mona Simpson met Amy Hempel, Susan Minot and Nancy Lemann (the 31-year-old author of the novel ''Lives of the Saints''). Susan and Nancy first knew each other at Brown University, where Gary Glickman later shared an apartment with Meg Wolitzer, who eventually introduced him to David Leavitt, with whom Gary now lives in East Hampton. David and Gary and Meg are good friends with Amy, and they know Susan and Mona and Nancy. And recently Meg, who is teaching this year at Skidmore College in Saratoga, N.Y., met Jay, who was spending some time nearby at Yaddo, the writers' colony. Jay, who blurbed Mona's book, also knows Susan, who was introduced to her publisher by Morgan Entrekin, whom she knew around town.

Lish is an editor at Knopf who also edits a new literary journal, The Quarterly. Many of the writers who have passed through his notoriously competetive workshops at Columbia University, in which they are required to bare their souls and have the results set up against each other, have remained close friends. And many have been published by Gordon Lish. ''Having endured combat together,'' he says facetiously, holds people together. He also observes, ''There is a community that provides shared experience for work, but there is a price to be paid in the distracting effects of envy, of the comparisons in terms of small successes. When the frame of competition is aimed at the right models - at the excellence of the composition of sentences - something quite wonderful can happen. If attention is paid to advances or who is getting published, or to statements made by some other writer over beer one day, it can be pernicious.''",NEW YORK'S SPINNING LITERARY CIRCLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/magazine/new-york-s-spinning-literary-circles.html

It can become claustrophobic. Nancy Lemann spends part of the year in her native New Orleans. ''Writers need a certain amount of real life around them,'' she says.

Often, they head out of the city merely to get a respite from its social demands. That's one reason why Tama Janowitz is at Princeton; why McInerney admits he must leave New York in order not to go out every night; why David Leavitt moved to Long Island from Manhattan. ''I couldn't work there anymore,'' says Leavitt.

6056,1987-04-05T05:00:00+0000,nyt://article/b46c42a4-9c0e-5052-93eb-50eee5b8b96f,3.0,"Ms. Gottlieb, the co-author of ''The Carpathian Caper,'' a novel, and of ''Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want,'' divides the ''Sixties generation'' into two groups - a first wave (born between 1944 and 1949) that she calls ''visionary'' and ''traumatized,'' and a second wave (born between 1950 and 1957) that she sees as ''low-key.'' The work of Stephen King, Steven Spielberg and Jonathan Schell represents to her the Zeitgeist of the first wave; John Sayles and Ann Beattie, she says, characterize the second. Obviously the millions of kids reaching adolescence in the 60's and 70's experienced what is now called ''the Sixties'' in different ways, and at different times - for many, the 60's didn't begin until the decade was almost over, and lasted well into the 70's. But Ms. Gottlieb senses in this generation as a whole a kind of family feeling that sets it apart from people born just a few years outside the boundaries. Introducing each person, she adds in parentheses the year of his or her birth, building by implication a gigantic ''us.'' And, indeed, much of the book is written in the first-person plural, as if Ms. Gottlieb (1946) felt herself to be the voice of a mystically united multitude.",AQUARIUS REVISTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/aquarius-revisted.html

''Sixties-generation taste runs to lots of plants, Eliot Porter and Ansel Adams photographs, good maps of favorite places, political posters in Polish or Spanish, and folk art,'' she reports. And the wide-eyed quality of some of her observations really is pure 60's, such as the revelation that ''we'' like to visit our friends. ''I stay with my friend in California, she stays with me in New York,'' Ms. Gottlieb marvels. ''Friends who have summer houses invite friends who don't. Visiting, we merge easily into a friend's family, wash dishes, cook.'' Like, wow. Despite the ardent simplicity of her reportage, Ms. Gottlieb's assessment of 60's politics is not uncritical. In fact, she seems eager to distance herself and her generation from the passions that most infuriated their elders 20 years ago. She credits the antiwar movement with ending the Vietnam War, for example, but strongly decries the ''anti-Americanism'' that inspired activists to burn flags and throw their sympathies to the Vietcong. Indeed, she admits finding ''just enough truth'' in President Reagan's evil-empire theory to ''confuse and tempt.'' She doesn't quite blame the victims at Kent State for getting themselves killed, but she analyzes the confrontation between student demonstrators and the armed National Guard as a clash between equals. ''We were cultural guerrillas . . . throwing psychic shock grenades,'' she writes, and argues quite seriously that the guardsmen were driven over the edge of reason by hearing young women shout obscenities. At the same time, however, she keeps faith with aspects of 60's ideology that lacked credibility even in the 60's. ''Did marijuana make us more intelligent?'' she wonders. PERHAPS her deepest allegiance is to the 60's-style religious quest, in which she sees the potential for an 80's-style political and moral activism. After their bouts with gurus, Zen masters and a slew of charlatans, Ms. Gottlieb's interviewees have settled down to a pleasant assortment of devotional practices, including tantric ritual, attendance at synagogue, worship at home altars, ''directed dreaming'' and vegetarianism. Ms. Gottlieb's favorite is ''Neo-Paganism,'' which she sees in action at a commune called the Magick Land; and she reverently lists its tenets (ecological awareness, ''natural psychic powers'' and an attitude of general benevolence) in the belief that they constitute a credo for ''our generation's 'religion.' '' And our religion, she emphasizes, is ''the same as our politics.'' None of those interviewed can readily define the new political order that they, with Ms. Gottlieb, can glimpse just over the horizon; but socially conscious mutual funds and the ''resacralizing of life'' seem to be its cornerstones.",AQUARIUS REVISTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/books/aquarius-revisted.html

If ever a history begged for perspective, it is the history of the 60's, an era defined overwhelmingly by adolescence. Listening to Ms. Gottlieb and her interviewees reflecting on their hitchhiking adventures, their drug trips, their spiritual quests and their sex lives is simply embarrassing, as if they were all reading aloud from their youthful diaries. Ms. Gottlieb's use of vulgarisms, as well as a wholly uncritical attitude toward the stupefying stories she has elicited, makes one suspect she identified so deeply with her material she was never able to gauge its inanity. By the time I finished ''Do You Believe in Magic?'' there was only one person in it I could bear: the author's niece.

Everyone in the painting (except the drowsy dog and a solicitous duenna) is looking out. The French philosopher Michel Foucault answered the question: What are they looking at?, by reminding us that in a mirror at the back of the canvas, the infanta's parents, King Philip and Queen Mariana, are reflected. Have they entered the scene, delightfully surprising all of those in it? Or are they the subject itself of the painting? Foucault goes on to give the spectator the place of the sovereigns. The painting looks at us; we look at the painting and, as the essayist and philosopher Ortega y Gasset observed in his study of Velazquez, a double dynamic is established: We are invited into the painting, but we also invite the painting out of itself toward us. The painting exists because we see it; do we, too, exist because the painting sees us? Would ''Las Meninas,'' without us its spectators, be but an errant star in the heavens of potentiality: a total un-self-conscious fact? Philip Roth quickly pinned down one aspect of our problem with ''Las Meninas'': the narrative possibilities of the painting, the infinite combinations of telling the material offered by Velazquez. Was Roth saying, in another way, the same thing as Bunuel, i.e., that the mediated verbal memory is perhaps stronger than the directly visual memory, because it demands a remove from the material, the recreation or representation of the visual evidence through indirect and invisible verbal means?","VELAZQUEZ, PLATO'S CAVE AND BETTE DAVIS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/arts/velazquez-platos-cave-and-bette-davis.html

It is incessantly proposed anew because we are never at ease with any definition of reality and its derivated rules: If this is real, then this must be unreal; if this is unreal, it is not true; if it is not true, it is not good; and if it is not good, true, or real, you should not see it and we have a right to destroy it. The most hieratic and authoritarian decisions on what reality is and is not, and what should be seen and not seen, from Egypt, Babylon and the Aztecs down to Stalin's socialist realism and the sublimated selection of images by contemporary commercial culture, have never been able to impose a completely closed way of seeing. The Aztecs wanted their sculptures to have an exclusively theocratic function. The anonymous artisans who carved them gave them a mysterious dimension (desire, imaginative freedom) that permits us to see them today beyond the limits of their sacred function, as works of art. The hierarchical and centripetal culture of the Middle Ages reached its most hermetical figuration in the Byzantine ikon: The Creator, one and only, stares fixedly at us from Eternity: A Nowhere without recognizable time and space. The extraordinary emotion of the figures in Piero della Francesca's frescos at Arezzo comes in part from the fact that they are no longer fixed, but in movement, and what moves is their sight: They are not only surrounded by a landscape and immersed in a time that are those of the 15th century; they are, most daringly, looking outside the boundaries of the mural: There is a world beyond the limits, and this might just be a different world, the world of others, the world where we do not recognize ourselves but are invited to recognize ourselves in the alien. Piero della Francesca died in 1492, when Columbus was discovering that the world had another, unknown half. Piero sees beyond the boundaries; and in his frescos at Sansepolcro, he makes his figures sleep and, perhaps, dream. What do they dream of? Perhaps, the New World. And perhaps the artist is indeed Rimbaud's little god, and this minigod invented the world and all that is in it, 20 seconds ago.

I'm certain that I missed the context of what Godard was saying, but I was struck by his idea and taken back to Velazquez, who is caught executing the painting that we are seeing. Velazquez's actual painting (the canvas of the painter-in-the-painting) is turning its back on us, and it is unfinished, whereas we are watching what we consider to be the completed product. But between these two central evidences, two big, wide and surprising spaces open. The first is the original scene itself: Velazquez painting, infanta and duennas surprised, gentlemen in black coming through lighted door, king and queen reflected in mirror. Did this scene occur? Was it posed, or did Velazquez simply imagine some or all of its components? And, second, was the painting ever finished? Velazquez was not a popular painter in his own day, Ortega y Gasset informs us, and he was faulted for showing unfinished paintings. The magic of vision in Velazquez is that from afar he seems to be faithfully reproducing ''reality.'' But at close quarters, we realize that the strokes are practically abstract, extremely free and unrealistic. Several modern painters who have obviously studied Velazquez have made this explicit: the British Walter Sickert and the Mexican Alberto Gironella, for example. But for an eminent contemporary of Velazquez, the poet Quevedo, the artist indulged in painting ''distant smudges.''","VELAZQUEZ, PLATO'S CAVE AND BETTE DAVIS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/arts/velazquez-platos-cave-and-bette-davis.html

El movimiento se demuestra andando, we say in Spanish: You demonstrate movement by moving. Movies bear this mission in their very name, and an immobile movie is a contradiction in terms. Literature is under no obligation to move, either physically or metaphorically; yet because motion does not come naturally to it, it is all the more creative to demand of it what, at first sight, it is not. Roth asks a painting not only to show, but to move narratively. Denis Diderot, the great spirit of the French 18th century, asked a novel not only to narrate, but to move: Do not describe, he begs, go to the fact; ''I meet a woman as beautiful as an angel . . .

But in the movies, Godard has to make a case for his artistic creativity because his esthetical vision is not part of most people's cultural assumptions: they believe that film is a copy, a postcard of Rembrandt, not the real artistic McCoy; it simply photographs reality, it does not create it. The sophisticated viewer knows that this is not so; there is as much creative choice in the succession of images of a Saturday matinee movie that tries to tell a straightforward story in a recognizable milieu, as in the unexpected, electrifying images of a Bunuel or Fellini, that try to shock us out of our complacent vision of what is visible.","VELAZQUEZ, PLATO'S CAVE AND BETTE DAVIS",https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/15/arts/velazquez-platos-cave-and-bette-davis.html

Yet the blind man's visual absence, and his corresponding fury at affirming his presence against the world he inherits, is what breaks the purely reproductive function of the film.

No asides, no ''Meninas,'' certainly, but certainly the most remarkable way of addressing you and me through the camera, of moving and looking and feeling in such a way that we have become the camera in response to the actresses' presence.

Bette Davis looks, as it were, at the screen, at the frame (not the camera, not the audience: the frame), which, I suspect, is what Godard would not have the TV screen rape. But Davis transforms that screen into a space as wide as Piero della Francesca's by her way of looking beyond the frame. And she substitutes Velazquez's direct gaze on the spectator through the bias of a movement that, one feels, is histrionic in order to be watched. This is not a naturalistic actress, but rather an actress who wants you to know that she is acting. The famous mannerisms are a way of calling your attention to the fact that she is an actress in a film, not really Queen Elizabeth or Empress Carlotta or a cockney barmaid or a (blind!) heiress. Like Don Quixote in his book, or Nathan Zuckerman in his ''Counterlife,'' she is inside an artistic medium, addressing us who read or see. Look at her go: The infanta simply shows us her crinoline; Davis slaps it, nervously, she goes on to slump in her throne, munching grapes and drinking from a goblet, then rises, slaps that crinoline again, goes to her mirror, slumps away while the beautiful Olivia de Havilland sings (Elizabethan) love songs on her mandolin. Davis rocks in her chair, sees her ugliness in a mirror and smashes it with her goblet. She cannot see herself any longer. She has broken the banality of the mirror held up to our own sight.

McLain, 23 years old, from Hempstead, L.I., told of his drug dependency and subsequent rehabilitation in a first-person story for the March 16 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. McLain wrote the story with Jeffrey Marx, a reporter with The Lexington Herald-Leader. ''I had played well on coke, I had played bad on it,'' McLain said. ''It didn't seem to matter. So I did about a quarter gram of blow before the national semifinal in the bathroom of room 135 of the Ramada Inn, about three miles from Rupp Arena. In the locker room I was all quiet and subdued. Everybody was saying, 'You all right? You all right?' I said, 'Yeah, I'm with it.' But in the meantime, I'd gotten it in my head that if we lost it didn't matter. I just wanted the season to be over.'' McLain scored 9 points and had 2 assists as Villanova defeated Memphis State, 52-45. The Wildcats then upset Georgetown, 66-64, to win the national title, with McLain getting 8 points and 2 assists. McLain began the article by recalling the team's subsequent visit to the White House: ''I was standing in the Rose Garden, wired on cocaine. . . . President Reagan was welcoming my teammates and me at the White House and giving his little speech about how inspirational our victory was. And the cocaine had me floating in my own private world.'' McLain said he was treated for drug abuse at the White Deer Treatment Center in Allenwood, Pa., last summer after he had been dismissed from his job as a broker trainee on Wall Street. McLain, who admitted he smoked marijuana in high school, said he was not the only basketball player at Villanova who got high but did not identify the other players in his article.",McLain's Drug Story,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/sports/sports-people-mclain-s-drug-story.html

''While our first priority is to provide help to those who need it, we will impose discipline where appropriate,'' the commissioner said. Hoyt, a 24-game winner with the Chicago White Sox in 1983, was traded to the San Diego Padres after the 1984 season. Last February, authorities who stopped him at the Mexican border said he was carrying three grams of marijuana and a quantity of unauthorized Valium and Quaalude pills. He paid an administrative fine. Later that month, the San Diego police said they found him in possession of marijuana and a switch-blade knife. He pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance. After getting treatment at a drug rehabilitation center, primarily for alcohol, he rejoined the Padres and compiled an 8-11 record with a 5.15 earned run average in 35 games. But he was arrested again last October, this time for marijuana and unauthorized possession of pills. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to 45 days. When the Padres released him Jan. 7, the team said it would not honor the remaining three years of his contract, and the Players Association filed a grievance in Hoyt's behalf. Last year, the commissioner penalized 11 players for their involvement with drugs but permitted them to play if they met certain conditions. All complied by donating a percentage of their salaries to drug-prevention programs, performing community service and submitting to drug tests. No such option was mentioned in Hoyt's case, however. Don Fehr, executive director of the players association, said it would be up to Hoyt and the pitcher's representatives if they want to appeal the commissioner's action. ''The saddest part is that everybody is lining up to throw darts at the guy,'' Fehr said. ''I used to think the worst thing that could happen to you in America was to get fired from your job. Now they've fired this guy and said he can't even work any place else.''",Hoyt Barred for Season,https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/26/sports/sports-people-hoyt-barred-for-season.html
