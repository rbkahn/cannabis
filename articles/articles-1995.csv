There is another film we must add to this list, according to the novelists Matthew Rettenmund and Jeff Gomez, and a very sorry cinematic specimen it is: John Hughes's mushy teen-age epic ""The Breakfast Club."" The narrator of Mr. Rettenmund's ""Boy Culture"" isolates something he calls ""the 'Breakfast Club' Syndrome,"" as if the film were sociologically or psychologically acute in some way; in ""Our Noise,"" one of Mr. Gomez's feckless 20-something characters claims that "" 'The Breakfast Club' seemed so real to me, like these were people I knew or else desperately wanted to know. . . .

Mr. Gomez chooses as his epigraph the smug observation that ""we are the people our parents warned us about,"" and in this context the slogan makes a different kind of sense: you can just imagine the Bob Dylan-loving, Kurt Vonnegut-reading parents of Mr. Gomez's music-obsessed creations throwing up their hands in horror when they discover they have raised children who swallow Mr. Hughes's banalities whole.",Twentysomething,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/twentysomething.html

Mr. Gomez's characters drink a lot (and as a consequence spend an unconscionable amount of time throwing up in bathrooms, an activity described with much relish here), listen to rock-and-roll, play in bands, eat pizzas, smoke marijuana and sleep with one another whenever possible. All this is conveyed with a sweet earnestness, suggesting that Mr. Gomez believes he is bringing us news in his first novel that we may not have heard before.

""Bloodsucking Fiends"" is about a woman who becomes, through no fault of her own, a vampire in contemporary San Francisco, but the novel has more in common with Ron Howard's ""Splash"" than with Bram Stoker's ""Dracula."" Tommy the supermarket stacker and wannabe writer falls in love with Jody the vampire, and what interests Mr. Moore the most is the potential for laughs in the ensuing culture clash.

However, the young gay men in Matthew Rettenmund's first novel, ""Boy Culture,"" really do inhabit a world that would have been unimaginable a couple of decades ago. AIDS, inevitably, with its attendant fears and rules, is part of the story, but not all of it. Mr. Rettenmund's male hustler, who calls himself X, a witty, frank and reflective narrator, reminds one of the dynamism and fluidity of contemporary gay culture. Whereas Jeff Gomez's references are over familiar and stale, even if one has never heard of half the indie bands he name-drops, Mr. Rettenmund's little throwaway deconstructions of Madonna (he previously wrote ""Encyclopedia Madonnica,"" a compendium of facts about the singer) and his run-through of current gay ""types"" are genuinely new.

Young white heterosexuals have never found themselves subjected to more scrutiny, in books and films and magazines, than they are now receiving, yet at the same time their culture seems to have become stuck: however much style writers try to inflate every tiny new detail of consumption into something of real significance, it is hard to shake the perception that there is nothing going on here. It is no wonder that Christopher Moore needs vampires to inject new blood into his whimsical romantic comedy; no wonder, either, that Matthew Rettenmund, with his sharp eye and his careful, knowing prose, sounds like one of the freshest voices on the block.

Not this time, though it's obvious why Mr. Mailer, whose prime subject has always been himself, might have spent more than three decades contemplating a biography of Pablo Picasso. On the other hand, it's not so easy to comprehend why, after all that time, he has come up with such a clumsy and disappointing book, culled, at startling lengths, from already existing biographies. With so many out there, most notably Volume 1 of John Richardson's monumental ""Life of Picasso,"" which covers nearly the same early years, one wonders what Mr. Mailer could have been thinking.",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html

Picasso emerges in a familiar guise, as a selfish, superstitious, sometimes cowardly and combative prodigy who moved chameleonlike from one style to another, through one relationship after the next. Mr. Mailer has called his work ""an interpretive biography,"" to distinguish it from a work of original scholarship. This is fair enough, but most of the interpretations are not original.",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html
415894,1995-10-15,nyt://article/13733fcb-fce1-5e34-92cf-9792c78bdfce,4.0,"For instance, Mr. Mailer is not the first to suggest, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that Picasso might have had a homosexual encounter or two as a young man. That dubious honor goes to Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington in her reckless ""Picasso: Creator and Destroyer."" Who cares one way or another, you might well ask, whether he had such an encounter? But like a dog with a bone, Mr. Mailer takes hold and won't let go. What is noteworthy about his book may be the vigor with which he pursues sensationalistic subjects like this one even while affecting a dispassion toward them. About a self-portrait drawing from 1902-3, for instance, in which Picasso stands with one hand raised, the other over his heart, Mr. Mailer writes: ""One can make too large a case of the nude he did of himself in this period -- modest, unadorned, a little seedy, certainly depressed, and taking the vow of allegiance to . . . to what? To his continuing heterosexuality? It is tempting to read too much into this drawing.""",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html

This self-portrait could be a preparatory drawing for an unrealized work, or possibly one for ""La Vie"" (1903). ""La Vie,"" as Mr. Mailer knows, derives from studies Picasso drew of himself making various ambiguous gestures. The gestures, as Mr. Richardson has pointed out, relate to images on tarot cards, which fascinated Picasso. It may be that the self-portrait Mr. Mailer refers to is better explained in terms of Picasso's other works than by random speculation about his sex life.",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html
415896,1995-10-15,nyt://article/13733fcb-fce1-5e34-92cf-9792c78bdfce,6.0,"Mr. Mailer also becomes fixated on the androgyny of the hulking proto-Cubist figures Picasso painted in 1906, connecting them to Gertrude Stein, whose portrait the artist was then painting. Mr. Mailer's remarks on the subject are worth quoting at length, to give a feel for his prose: ""It is safe to assume that Gertrude Stein was the most monumental crossover in gender that he had ever encountered. He had to be knowing about this. With Fernande [Olivier, Picasso's mistress], he had entered the essential ambiguity of deep sex, where one's masculinity or femininity is forever turning into its opposite, so that a phallus, once emplaced within a vagina, can become more aware of the vagina than its own phallitude -- that is to say, one is, at the moment, a vagina as much as a phallus, or for a woman vice versa, a phallus just so much as a vagina: at such moments, no matter one's physical appearance, one has, in the depths of sex, crossed over into androgyny. Picasso was obsessed with the subject.""",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html
415897,1995-10-15,nyt://article/13733fcb-fce1-5e34-92cf-9792c78bdfce,7.0,"Leave aside for the moment the paradox of Mr. Mailer's twisted syntax in a book that takes art historians and critics to task for their writing. The basic fact is that Mr. Mailer says Stein influenced Picasso's art. So she did, and Picasso even incorporated an image of a man into her portrait. But scholars have pointed all this out already: Mr. Mailer is appropriating their ideas just to indulge in the sort of grandiose flourishes that are a trademark of his style. In any case, it becomes hard to weigh Stein's significance because other obvious influences on Picasso -- like the large women in the works of Renoir and Maillol -- are glossed over or missed. Mr. Mailer is so enraptured by the affairs of the artist's life that he regularly plays down the connections between Picasso's works and those of other artists. To be sure, he isn't alone in this. Picasso has largely been written about in terms of his biography. The exception is his Cubist period, and Mr. Mailer is right in this case to lament the ""near impenetrability"" of so much of the critical jargon attending it. ""Cubism is not a form of lovemaking with the lights out: Cubism is compelling because it is eerie, resonant and full of the uneasy recognition that time itself is being called into question,"" he writes. ""Some of the paintings, if we dare to entertain the vision, have the appearance of corpses, their flesh in strips and tatters, organs open.""",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html

The collaboration of Picasso and Braque on the creation of Cubism is almost unparalleled in art history, and it would seem to have afforded Mr. Mailer a vast psychological field in which to let his imagination play. What is one to think of a man like Picasso, he might have asked, who on the verge of success suddenly chose to make difficult pictures virtually indistinguishable from someone else's? But Mr. Mailer ignores this question to hop on an old hobbyhorse: in life, he writes, ""Braque had legitimate machismo,"" but in art he ""cannot often come off like Picasso. Machismo, obviously, has its mansions and no one was going to be more macho than Picasso when it came to painting.""

Olivier lived with Picasso from 1905 until 1912. She has said that she kept diaries at the time and that her memoirs derived from them.

He of all people would seem equipped to write a vivid and original book about Picasso, since he shares with the artist, if not the same degree of talent, then the characteristics of a long public career, prolific output, Rolodex of styles, sexual fixation, narcissism, will to power and compunction to parlay his own life into art.",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html

And his willingness to rationalize away Picasso's disregard for, even violence toward, lovers and friends will ring a bell with readers of such Mailer classics as ""The Naked and the Dead"" and ""The White Negro."" But the links between him and Picasso must be gleaned with some effort from the book. If anything, Mr. Mailer doesn't put enough of himself into it, relying on the idiosyncrasy of his prose to carry readers along. Picasso, who had no patience for art criticism, once praised Jean Genet's writing on Giacometti, which was personal and self-exploratory. It is the type of writing one hopes for from Mr. Mailer -- more like ""The Armies of the Night,"" with its blend of intense self-scrutiny and reportage, and less like his cut-and-paste ""Marilyn."" Mr. Mailer might have written a more distinctive book about Picasso if he had observed his own maxim: ""It's impossible to truly comprehend others until one's plumbed the bottom of certain obsessions about oneself.""",Tough Guys Don't Paint,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/books/tough-guys-don-t-paint.html

The resulting book is less a real biography than an assemblage of other people's words, glued together with Mr. Mailer's own musings and speculation.

Other times the result is simply a lot of Maileresque mumbo jumbo: ""One is tempted to argue that Cubism grew out of the inside of the nose for, indeed, its interior is often a cavernous, clotted, intricate web, full of bogs, stalactites, stalagmites, filamentlike hairs.""",Egos and Outlaws: Like Attracts Like,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/29/books/books-of-the-times-egos-and-outlaws-like-attracts-like.html

While this canvas's thick brushwork and primitive energy seem to owe a distinct debt to van Gogh, Mr. Mailer bizarrely argues that it is ""the first of Picasso's paintings to lead us into deeper perceptions than we might arrive at on our own, or by familiarity with other paintings,"" a painting in which Picasso ""is making his own statement at last.""

Mr. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University, was then teaching at Harvard.

And, indeed, Mr. Loury emerges in this collection of elegantly thought-out essays as too complex and subtle a thinker to dwell in anybody's pigeonhole. If there is an underlying theme in these essays, it is that too much effort is wasted in symbolic posturing, in adopting positions mainly to avoid giving comfort to the political or racial enemy. What the country needs, he maintains, is a hard, unsparing look at the central, perplexing and emotion-laden problem of race and poverty in America.",A Conservative Who's Outgrown His Pigeonhole,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/books/books-of-the-times-a-conservative-who-s-outgrown-his-pigeonhole.html

Mr. Loury is especially harsh in his judgments of what he calls the liberal civil rights establishment and the black intellectuals who are part of it, charging them at one point with ""an almost criminal abdication of responsibility.""

Carl Williams, and Karen Spinner, director of public education and policy for the New Jersey Association on Correction, a not-for-profit group interested in improving the state's criminal justice and correction systems, to talk about what the report means.","Crime's Down, but Why?

416793,1995-07-30,nyt://article/a3fa9445-7ac8-5892-98a9-7a5abd40e1bf,5.0,"Q. Why is the crime rate falling? WILLIAMS One of the reasons that crime is down is the aggressive approach against crime by all law enforcement agencies, local, state, county and Federal, working together as a team. Maybe five years ago the arrest would stop with the individual officer on the street. Now with all the various task forces and the communication they allow between the agencies, we're taking that arrest further than it was taken before and trying to apprehend the source. SPINNER A higher level of police presence or activity will hold down certain kinds of crime. But also some of the preventive things that are being done, some of the recent emphasis on conflict resolution in the schools, those kinds of seeds planted with young people and even older folks can lead to a lessening of aggression and the need or the propensity to commit crime. Q. Does putting more people in jail, as New Jersey is doing, tend to decrease crime? SPINNER No. If you look at the last 15 years , we've at least quadrupled our prison population, and we don't see a corresponding decrease in the amount of crime. I don't think putting our resources there has made much difference. I think putting our resources on the front end -- prevention and enforcement -- has a more important impact. WILLIAMS I take a different view. With those individuals who are career criminals, our ability to put them away for long periods of time does have an impact on the incidence of crime. Incarcerating people who need to be incarcerated and keeping them there does help our crime rate go down, and it sends a subtle message to those out there who are thinking about doing something similar. I think that's one of the aggressive aspects of this administration, with the ""three strikes and you're in"" bill. SPINNER But the three-strikes bill was just signed, so you couldn't really attribute the decreasing crime to that. WILLIAMS Three strikes has been talked about on the national level for a couple of years now, and it was just a matter of time before it was passed here in New Jersey. An individual contemplating doing something might think twice if they think that by the time they get around to their [ third ] conviction some law like three strikes might be in effect. Q. Arrests for sex offenses are down 5 percent from last year. Do you think Megan's Law, even though it wasn't passed until the end of October, had any effect in 1994? WILLIAMS I think it's too early to tell with Megan's Law exactly what impact it will have, but I think people are thinking twice before they do things. SPINNER I would suspect that for situational sex offenders, those who find themselves in a situation where they were robbing someone and take the opportunity to abuse them sexually, Megan's Law may be a deterrent. But for compulsive sex offenders, I don't think Megan's Law has an impact. Q. While violent crime is down, violent crimes committed with guns increased slightly, about half a percent. Should we tighten our gun laws again? WILLIAMS I think the tightening has to be nationwide. SPINNER I don't know what you do about guns except that you work with kids and help them understand how dangerous they are. Q. Arrests of juveniles increased by 6percent in 1994. Are we getting a handle on juvenile crime, which has been such a focus of concern in the past couple of years? WILLIAMS We're trying. The Governor and the Attorney General's commission [ on juvenile justice ] is starting to review the juvenile laws here in New Jersey, and most police departments are starting to put more emphasis on the problems they're having with juveniles. SPINNER When you look at how few police departments have a significantly large juvenile unit, you realize that if you really want to be serious about dealing with kids you have to assign officers to them and train them to deal specifically with kids. Q. How do you account for the 13 percent jump in drug arrests? More drug use or more aggressive policing, or both? WILLIAMS I think it's a combination. Statistics show that the use of marijuana among our younger generation is starting to increase again, and we still have to be aggressive in our interdiction program. Q. Does law enforcement in New Jersey need to change anything it's doing now? WILLIAMS The only thing I would say as far as change is concerned is that we can't change back to the way it was before when we kind of disregarded teamwork and cooperation between all law-enforcement agencies. SPINNER I'd like to see more resources devoted to kids. If we can interdict a child early on in his or her career, we might save ourselves a lot of aggravation down the line.","Crime's Down, but Why?

RETHINKING WELFARE Block Grants THE GOAL -- Block Grants, or lump sum Federal payments made directly to the states, would gove more states control over Federal aid to low-income people without the bureaucratic strings attached in Washington. House Republicans say a block-grant system would control costs and rein in the growth of entitlements. THE PROPOSALS HOUSE PLAN Under a welfare bill passed by the House, Federal entitlement program including family assistance and school lunch subsidies would by replaced by block grants that states could use as they wished to aid the poor. The money would be earmarked for specific purposes, but states would be able to set benefits and eligibility criteria. GOVERNORS PLAN Republican governors say the House bill would still impose too many restrictions on them. It would, for example, set a five year limit on Federal welfare payments to a family and would bar the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to unmarried teen-age mothers. The governors have devised an alternative proposal that would give them more say over eligibility rules. They would also replace the food stamp program, which the House bill would keep at the Federal level, with block grants. EFFECT ON STATES -- Some governors fear that under the House proposal many poor people would be out of luck if demand for services outran a state's grant or if state officials were unable to administer such complicated programs. Some critics also fear that the money would not be evenly distributed among the states.",Rethinking Welfare: Interstate Migration -- A special report.; Larger Benefits Lure Chicagoans to Wisconsin,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/08/us/rethinking-welfare-interstate-migration-special-report-larger-benefits-lure.html

In its pioneering of the vernacular first person, its search for authentic American experience among the dispossessed and traditionally voiceless and its use of comedy to bring home grim realities in ways that gravity cannot, ""Huckleberry Finn"" is a bantamweight story with a heavyweight's impact. Of the many writers working in the great tradition today, one of the best is Russell Banks. In novels like ""Affliction"" and ""Continental Drift"" Mr. Banks has deepened Hemingway's investigation of American maleness, lending a voice to working-class fathers who want to be ""good"" men but are reduced, by economic brutalities and some essential rage riding on the Y chromosome, to bad ones. Now, in ""Rule of the Bone,"" his 12th book, Mr. Banks has returned to the source of sources and reinvented ""Huckleberry Finn.""",Hitting the Road,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/books/hitting-the-road.html

In his parents' closet, Chappie finds a cache of old coins that he can pawn in small batches. It's a teen-age weed fiend's dream, but, as he sadly admits, he's a clumsy thief. His mother and stepfather throw him out of the house, and he embarks on a lowlife tour of upstate New York, dealing dope at the local mall and hiding out with a brutish motorcycle gang called Adirondack Iron. Mr. Banks has the milieu down cold. ""I can hear Megadeth thumping through the walls,"" Chappie says, ""and I can smell dope smoke and pizza and can hear the refrigerator being opened and closed and the top-popping of beer cans.

Skipping town, he has himself tattooed with a crossbones and rechristens himself Bone.

Returning to this bus after various adventures, Bone encounters the novel's Jim character, a runaway migrant farm worker from Jamaica who calls himself I-Man. Bone and I-Man make a home in the bus, with a kitchen garden and a cash crop of cannabis, and it's here, as Mr. Banks trades the aimless fun of the picaresque for the moral responsibilities of the Bildungsroman, that the story flags a little. The genre dictates that Bone learn lessons from I-Man, and although Mr. Banks is too good a novelist to dehumanize I-Man with saintliness, the reader may squirm at the alacrity with which Bone embraces the manners, the philosophy, even the cooking, of the old Jamaican.

Along the way, Bone sneers at American vacationers who are ""too scared of black people to buy ganja from them,"" and you wonder if the author, whose knowledge of backwoods Jamaica is obviously firsthand, isn't sneering a little himself. More bravely than almost any other contemporary writer, however, Mr. Banks is wrestling with what it means to be a white man in a multicultural world. A central insight of his oeuvre is the kinship of frustrated Snow Belt whites with desperate black Caribbeans, and in ""Rule of the Bone,"" by reinterpreting Twain, he extends that insight to the whole tangle of race relations in America: the evil isn't whiteness but the white political economy, and the abuse of any child, black or white, is tantamount to slavery.

Bone is more generic and less funny than Holden Caulfield, and unlike Holden, he displays an odd immunity to pop culture. It's as if J. D. Salinger registered 40 years in advance a commercialized teen-age reality that Mr. Banks himself shies away from. Mr. Banks also falls short of Mr. Salinger's artistry in filtering acute psychological observation through vernacular distortion. But the comparison is not entirely fair. In his social and economic privilege, Holden Caulfield is so familiar to educated readers that Mr. Salinger can afford the luxury of subtlety. Bone, on the other hand, has had as little exposure to ""sivilization"" as Huck Finn did, and in order to rescue him from muteness Mr. Banks is compelled, a la Twain, to place him in fantastic situations. If the resulting story seems unrealistically bleak and its hero incompletely lovable -- if you balk at the unrelenting depiction of white adults as selfish, cruel and criminal -- it's worth remembering that for kids like Bone the state of innocence to which Holden longs to return has never been an option; they would be happy to meet adults whose worst sin is phoniness. Intoxicating and unsparing, ""Rule of the Bone"" is a romance for a world fast running out of room for childhood.

Drink in hand, Maryann is always there to share wit and wisdom about Cybill's daughters and ex-husbands. And Cybill is there for Maryann, who has been known to telephone her friend from her walkin closet, nervous that she is seconds from going to bed with a new man. Cybill and Maryann lunch together, work out at the gym together, stalk Maryann's ex-husband together and commiserate on the trials of life after 40. They're part of a long line of sitcom female best friends. But oh, how those twosomes have evolved! They've always been women of their times. ANITA GATES Lucy and Ethel, 1951-57 Era -- Life revolved around home and husbands when Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) were pals on ""I Love Lucy"" (CBS). The girls always wanted to go to a nightclub; the boys always wanted to go to the fights. Living Arrangements -- The same New York Apartment building. Specialty -- Silly capers. Balance of Power -- The Mertzes own the building, but Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel are round and middle-aged while Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Lucy have youth and beauty on their side. Lucy is a little nuts, but Ethel almost always goes along with her schemes, from dressing up as Martians to sneaking into Richard Widmark's backyard. Lucy returns the favor at least once, posing as the Mertzes' maid to impress a visiting friend of Fred's. Togetherness -- The couples go everywhere together (Hollywood, Europe), and when the Ricardos move to Connecticut, the Mertzes soon follow. Loyalty -- Stong, but when Lucy loses her bit part in an Italian movie by soaking up local color literally (during a fight with a fellow grape stomper), Ethel accepts the movie part herself. Gleefully. Mary and Rhoda, 1970-74 Era -- In the 70's, when Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore, right) and Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) were best friends on CBS's ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" working women who were over 30 and single had to stick together. Living Arrangements -- Apartments in the same Minneapolis house. Specialty -- Moral support. Balance of Power -- Mary is prettier and thinner and has a better job (television news producer; Rhoda is a window dresser) and a nicer apartment. Even Rhoda's mother likes Mary better. But Rhoda is braver (she even calls Mary's boss by his first name). Togetherness -- Largely home-base, although Rhoda does turn up at Mary's office now and then. Loyalty -- Strong. Mary takes in Mrs. Morgenstern when Rhoda decides she can't deal with one more maternal visit. Rhoda stays up all night helping Mary meet a deadline for writing obituaries. Still, after four seasons, Rhoda dumps her and leaves town faster than you can say ""spinoff."" Laverne and Shirley, 1976-82 Era -- ABC's ""Laverne and Shirley"" was set in the 1950's (as seen nostalgically from the feminist 70's), when single women shared a single goal: as Shirley says just after Laverne has gone face-down into a chopped-liver sculpture, ""I just thought that we might meet a couple of rich guys."" Living Arrangements -- Laverne De Fazio (Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams) share a modest apartment in Milwaukee. Specialty -- Silly man-hunting capers. Laverne gets her hand stuck in a crematory urn while trying to impress a handsome mortician. Balance of Power -- Shirley is naive. Laverne is manipulative. Togetherness -- They work together at a brewery and double-date a lot. When Shirley really, really wants to attend a cocktail party at the Pfister Hotel to meet businessmen, Laverne accompanies her, even though she has just completed a sleep-deprivation experiment and keeps sliding to the floor. Loyalty -- After the characters relocate to California, Shirley marries and moves overseas, leaving Laverne to face cancellation alone. Kate and Allie, 1984-89 Era -- On CBS's ""Kate and Allie,"" 1980's women had problems that Lucy and Ethel could barely have imagined. Living Arrangements -- Kate McArdle (Susan Saint James, right) and Allie Lowell (Jane Curtin), both divorced, live with their total of three children in a big New York apartment. At one point, they pretend to be lesbians so the landlady won't throw them out for being a two-family household. Specialties -- Hugs and late-night talks about love, children and life. Balance of Power -- Kate is cooler, more worldly; Allie is old-fashioned and keeps tranquilizers in the spice rack. Togetherness -- Allie stays home to cold-shower Kate out of an accidental sedative overdose. Kate rushes home from work when Allie calls, panicked about her 17-year-old daughter's intentions to have sex. Eventually the two women open a catering business. Loyalty -- Even after Allie remarries, Kate moves in with her. Patsy and Edina, 1992- Era -- The 90's, but the dissolute, self-indulgent heroines of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (BBC; shown here on Comedy Central since 1994) refuse to leave the 60's. Living Arrangements -- No one understands Edina Monsoon (Jennifer Saunders, left), who lives in a chic London house. Thank God for Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), who lives somewhere within taxicab distance and keeps moving in. Specialties -- Drinking (Bollinger is a favorite), drug use (Patsy smuggles marijuana into Morocco in her Ivana Trump hairdo), shopping, belittling Eddy's annoyingly sensbile teen-age daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha), and complaining in spoken italics (""Why can't life just be made a little easier?"" Eddy asks a traffic court judge). Balance of Power -- Patsy, a magazine fashion director who often can't find her office, has the more glamorous job and looks. But Eddy, a publicist, holds all the cards, as her daughter and her best friend fight for her love. Togetherness -- Absolute. When Eddy was hospitalized for foot surgery (a lost acupuncture needle), Patsy checked in for moral support -- and a face-lift. Loyalty -- Total. Who but Patsy would call Saffron pretending to be the Betty Ford Clinic confirming Edina's reservation? Hope and Gloria, 1995- Era -- Here and now (NBC's ""Hope and Gloria""). Living Arrangements -- The same apartment building in Pittsburgh. Specialty -- Too soon to tell. Balance of Power -- Mixed. Hope Davidson (Cynthia Stevenson), recently dumped by her unfaithful husband, is a television producer so meek she accepts applying cream cheese to her boss's bagel as part of her job. Gloria Utz (Jessica Luncy) is a twice-divorced hairdresser and mother of one who carries a tote bag the size of a coffee table and talks back to just about anyone. Togetherness -- Growing. They do visit each other's apartments constantly. Loyalty -- Promising, but Hope could have been alittle more supportive when she hired Gloria at the television station, then pretty much took the job offer back.",Through Thick and Thin (Thin?

Otis Chambers was graduating from Lee Senior High School that night in May, William M.

A sometime journalist with a low-profile byline, she's not the kind of 43-year-old who ordinarily gets a $75,000 advance for an autobiography, which may be why she's so gauche as to reveal that handsome if hardly precedent-setting figure. Well, good for her -- Ms. Maran believes in letting it all hang out, and her unexpectedly compelling book, ""What It's Like to Live Now,"" would lose most of its charm if she didn't.",A Child of the 60's,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/books/a-child-of-the-60-s.html

Born toward the young end of the baby-boomer generation, Ms. Maran was precocious, organizing antiwar marches at the Bronx High School of Science when she was 15. Over the next 25 years she would hang out on the Lower East Side, help build a commune near Taos, N.M., join the Berkeley Women's Health Collective, put in nearly a decade of Marxist union organizing with the October League and a grass-roots community group in San Jose, Calif. She would work on an assembly line and in a sex shop, for Banana Republic and Smith & Hawken and Working Assets. She would consume considerable marijuana and LSD, try Kundalini yoga and Zen and co-counseling and icky-sounding New Age meditation techniques and even the Judaism she was born to, experiment with holistic therapies and turn to vegetarianism, undergo an abortion and a lumpectomy and years of infertility treatment, see dear friends through infertility and cancer and AIDS, and undergo $35,000 worth of psychotherapy. She would marry and bear two sons, both of them now teen-agers, then discover that she preferred the other half of her avowed bisexuality in a 10-years-and-counting relationship with a woman who shares the mortgage on a house in Oakland (but not necessarily the bed, not every night -- they both still need their own space).",A Child of the 60's,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/books/a-child-of-the-60-s.html

This quality is called charisma in the famous, and shrugged off with a ""What can you do?"" in the powerful. In ordinary folks like Meredith Maran, however, it's deeply resented outside of a small circle of friends. Unintentionally, I believe, ""What It's Like to Live Now"" functions as a convincing defense of this character formation. Meredith Maran may be a pain in the neck sometimes. But she's nice!

Watching the gardeners at work in their windowless cubicles, deftly transforming one plant into a dozen over and over again, I understood why the Netherlands had become such an important model for indoor marijuana growers. Horticulture in Holland has always been a matter of artifice, of forcing nature in every sense. Almost all of Holland's farmland is man-made, reclaimed from the North Sea (the recent flood notwithstanding) by dint of effort and technology. Cursed with little sunlight and even less space, the Dutch have also had to master the art of indoor growing -- of, essentially, combining large quantities of electricity and chemical fertilizer with the best plant genetics available to create gorgeous flowers, picture-perfect tomatoes and, now, some of the world's most refined marijuana plants.",HOW POT HAS GROWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/magazine/how-pot-has-grown.html

Sensors will monitor the five important environmental factors (light, water, humidity, carbon dioxide levels and temperature) and feed the information to a personal computer. Using solenoid switches, a so-called ""smart interface"" and a bit of customized programming, the computer can track and automatically adjust all these variables, either according to a preset program or to instructions typed in by the gardener.

An article in the October High Times offered plans for a similar security system, adding one diabolical twist.

End acceptance of drug bazaars in Harlem and southeast Washington that would not be tolerated on the Upper East Side of New York or in Georgetown.* Encourage judges with lots of drug cases to employ public health professionals, just as they hire economists to assist with antitrust cases.* Cut off welfare payments to drug addicts and alcoholics who refuse to seek treatment and pursue after-care.

Speaker Gingrich and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have done the nation a disservice by playing all-or-nothing politics with this issue. The compassionate and cost-effective middle ground is to identify those parents who abuse their children by their own drug and alcohol abuse and place those children in decent orphanages and foster care until the parents shape up.* Subject inmates, parolees and welfare recipients with a history of substance abuse to random drug tests, and fund the treatment they need. Liberals must recognize that getting off drugs is the only chance these individuals (and their babies) have to enjoy their civil rights.
