This kind of Federal blackmail subverts the intent of the 21st Amendment, which not only repealed Prohibition but specifically forbade the Federal Government to meddle in states' alcohol policies.

5,1984-12-31,nyt://article/eb2cf6aa-d279-5e58-9ed7-e2151a8fcaa4,6.0,"If saving lives is the rationale behind raising the national drinking age, there is an easier way to do it. ''Raising the drinking age can save only 5 to 15 percent of teenage auto fatalities,'' says Yale's Leon Robertson, ''but raising the driving age can spare 65 to 80 percent.'' We should establish a single majority age so that alcohol doesn't stand out as a major attraction to the young. To stop drunken driving, all of us must become part of the solution. We can do this through education. We've already shown people how they can preserve their health by quitting smoking, exercising, eating better and reducing stress. We teach unskilled people how to save lives with the Heimlich maneuver, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and various life-saving measures. Why not use similar techniques to combat drunkenness? We already have easily learned techniques on how to spot, interrupt and prevent impending intoxication. We can't look away when family members, friends, colleagues and co-workers overdose with alcohol and become dangerous to themselves and others. Alcohol is a drug - a central nervous system depressant - not far removed pharmacologically from barbiturates. Yet people feel free in dispensing it recklessly and irresponsibly. By calling alcohol a drug I'm not calling it a dirty name. My feelings about alcohol are similar to those of Winston Churchill, who once said, ''I have taken more good from alcohol than alcohol has taken from me.'' I contend that society has taken more good from alcohol than alcohol has taken from society. A landmark decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court that holds social hosts liable for the actions of guests who get drunk forces us to realize that people around the drinker contribute to the state of drunkenness. Consumer activists tell us that businesses should be responsible for their products and services. The court's 6-to-1 decision tells us that we are responsible for the behavior of our drinking guests. When people no longer feel that getting drunk is an acceptable part of drinking, and when the liquor and hospitality industries train their employees in responsible sale and service, drunken driving will cease to be a major social problem. Perhaps the increasing threat of litigation, following the New Jersey decision, will finally bring us to our social senses.B",HOW TO COMBAT DRUNKENNESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/31/opinion/how-to-combat-drunkenness.html

Tourism accounts for two of every three jobs, and 80 percent of the tourists come from the United States. Many of the large hotels and resorts are owned or managed by Americans. More than 100 American banks and trust companies have branches in the Bahamas. Many people and businesses shift some of their income and investments to the Bahamas, where there are no personal or corporate income taxes. Strategically situated between North and South America, the islands were a base for buccaneers and privateers in the 17th century, a way station for ships running the Union blockade of Confederate ports in the Civil War, and a base for bootleggers smuggling liquor into the United States during Prohibition. Today, much of the cocaine and marijuana arriving in the United States passes through the Bahamas, according to drug enforcement officials in Washington. Bahamian officials insist that they should not be held responsible, any more than the Governor of Florida is held responsible for drugs that pass through his state. But the commission of inquiry said that ''the whole nation must accept some responsibility,'' because ''apathy and weak public opinion have led to the present unhappy and undesirable state of affairs.'' Dissident members of Mr. Pindling's Progressive Liberal Party had been expected to challenge his leadership in October at a party convention held amid the palm groves of Paradise Island, just north of downtown Nassau. They reasoned that he was losing popularity because of the uproar over corruption in the Government. Arthur D. Hanna, a longtime friend of the Prime Minister and a possible rival, resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, warning that the party must not permit anything to ''open a hole'' in its ''armor of integrity,'' which ''could insure the demise of the Progressive Liberal Party as a political and moral force in the Bahamas.'' But in the end, the party re-elected Mr. Pindling as party leader without opposition, hailing him as a nation-builder who had led the Bahamas to full independence in 1973 and to black majority rule.

Mexicans of all classes blame corruption for the economic crisis that engulfed the country in 1982. They are bitter about the $20 billion that was shipped out of Mexico during the three preceding years and the widely publicized rackets of many top officials. If they are to believe in the new Government, they want radical action. For Mr. de la Madrid, there is also an opportunity. He succeeded a deeply unpopular President; he took over a system of government that, while internally strong, is despised by many Mexicans, and he inherited an economy caught in its worst recession since the 1930's. Unable to offer anything but bad news on the economic front, he is seeking political good will by promising honesty. And on that, more than anything else, his Government will be judged. Already he has done more to combat corruption than anyone in memory. But with the practice so much a part of the Mexican way of life, public skepticism still runs deep. For some Mexicans, a visit to Mr. Durazo's house, rather than reassuring them that change is upon them, serves only to confirm their opinion of their rulers - past, present and future.","CORRUPTION, MEXICAN STYLE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/magazine/corruption-mexican-style.html

Anne Campbell, a social psychologist and a trained observer of New York City gangs, tells us such gangs are conservative in their politics and that notions of class are as alien to street gangs as they are to other groups in the United States, a country in which the working class has no political party, no philosophy or culture of its own. Street gangs are a manifestation of this phenomenon - teen-agers and young adults, recruited from the slums, use them to promote their territorial, ethnic and personal imperatives. The gangs' disdain of the law and readiness to do violence have often made them useful allies and tools of politicians and criminals, and more recently of drug barons and ''poverty pimps,'' those who have managed to profit from poverty programs.

We hang out on their Harlem corner as Connie supervises marijuana sales. We sweep into battle with rival gangs, come to understand some of the male Sandman members and listen as Connie reveals her inner strivings.

And Connie sets high store on the respect of the community. Still, sexuality and love for her man and her kids are everything to her. Connie battles beside Gino on the street, holds a knife to a chick who tries to snatch her man. She bosses all female and male gang members except Gino and she rages at him, demanding fidelity and respect. She broods about machismo and its consequences, dreads promiscuity and abandonment.

The most recent narcotics intelligence estimate, published by the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee (N.N.I.C.C.), states that in 1983 only 11 percent of the marijuana consumed in our country was domestically grown. This represents a decrease from the previous year - a sign, according to marijuana experts, that the eradication program is working. Mr. Chapple is attempting to play on Americans' sympathy by predicting that organized crime will become involved in the marijuana business if the Government does not let up on enforcement. Since when should the Government's actions be dictated by potential organized-crime involvement? In any case, legalization of marijuana cultivation to avoid crime involvement is a specious argument: organized crime is involved in a variety of legitimate enterprises. The House Select Committee on Narcotics recognizes the severity of the marijuana problem, which is fostering lawlessness, violence and the destabilization of communities in such states as California, Hawaii and Oregon. We suggest that Mr. Chapple speak to the Oregon hunter who stumbled across a marijuana field last month and was shot in the head with his two companions. They survived to tell law-enforcement officials that they had been left for dead by the cultivators who were protecting their crop.

Nonetheless, viewed from a wider perspective, they barely affected the worldwide picture. ''We can hurt the trafficker,'' a United States drug enforcement official said, ''but we never really hurt the traffic.'' Neither Peruvian nor American officials were sure who fired the submachine guns in the raid on a jungle campsite at Monzon, 200 miles northeast of Lima. The program was suspended, a State Department official said, ''until we can get a clearer picture'' of who was behind the attack and its long-term meaning. It was the second suspension in Peru in three months. This year, the United States antidrug program is spending $4.2 million in Peru, where nearly half the world's coca leaf grows. Most of the cocaine produced from it is consumed in the United States. But even if all the Peruvian coca plants were pulled from the ground tomorrow, Amerian officials acknowledge, the other big coca-growing countries - Bolivia and Colombia - could produce more than enough cocaine to supply world demand. The same unbalanced array of forces faces drug enforcement officials after the Mexican marijuana raid. The Mexicans arrested seven Federal police officers in the raid, which helps explain why the marijuana plantations escaped notice for so long, United States officials said. Using slave labor, the drug traffickers in northern Mexico had grown 10,000 tons of marijuna, eight times as much as Mexican and American officials had believed was produced in all of Mexico in a year.

Ginsberg embraced this approach, which already was being separately championed by some poets across the river in New York City and others out in San Francisco.",ALLEN GINSBERG: INTIMATIONS OF MORTALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/11/magazine/allen-ginsberg-intimations-of-mortality.html

His early pictures of Kerouac, Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Robert Creeley, Anne Waldman and numerous other writers are basic archival material now, and his technique is appreciated enough to merit a gallery show of Ginsberg's photos next year in New York. The picture-taking reinforces another tenet of Ginsberg's writing technique, the description of ''epiphanous moments,'' a kind of freeze- framing in words of a witnessed moment ''under the aspect of eternity'' that artists crave. Seeking that aspect, Ginsberg writes to capture ''the dearness of the vanishing moment and the realization that the show, life, lasts a limited number of years.''",ALLEN GINSBERG: INTIMATIONS OF MORTALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/11/magazine/allen-ginsberg-intimations-of-mortality.html

This seems the challenge he finds most pressing in such poets as Whitman. He is fascinated with Whitman's witnessing of Lincoln and of Lincoln's suffering as what Ginsberg calls a ''poignant moment'' that existed more than a century ago for those two men, yet survives now in Whitman's writing. ''Whitman's basic tone toward Lincoln was tenderness,'' says Ginsberg, who makes the point that accuracy through subjective witnessing, not applied emotion, must bear the artist into the future: ''And Whitman's tenderness comes not from an arbitrary infusion of good will, but from the very circumstances of suffering.''",ALLEN GINSBERG: INTIMATIONS OF MORTALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/11/magazine/allen-ginsberg-intimations-of-mortality.html

She shocked him by responding with a letter of eerie clarity that was written, he estimates, no more than a day before she suddenly died from a stroke. When Ginsberg later wrote ''Kaddish'' for her, he ended with her strange but welcome words of concern from the letter: ''The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight in the window - I have the key - Get married Allen don't take drugs - the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window.

She was still poor and in need of care, but she was finally able, beyond all the incoherent shrieking years of madness, to talk with her son so they could reconcile. She asked for help and Allen was relieved to stay with her and shop for her and cook for her. And next to her shopping-bag station was a vacant apartment for an aging poet.

They turned to marijuana from Colombia and to domestic sinsemilla, an extraordinarily potent variety that had been a limited, connoisseur's option. When the Reagan Administration launched its relatively successful ''War on Drugs'' against Colombian marijuana, once again there was an increased demand for home-grown marijuana. In 1982, Frank Monastero, then head of operations with the Drug Enforcement Agency, said: ''With the continued pressure on foreign sources, the temptation to the trafficker to seek other sources of supply, especially domestic, is irresistible.''",A MYOPIC APPROACH TO MARIJUANA,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/09/opinion/a-myopic-approach-to-marijuana.html

Fall is the peak harvest, and helicopters have been landing in California, Hawaii, Georgia and other states, the officers often armed with M-16 rifles. But growers have simply turned from row-cropping marijuana, like corn, to hiding and camouflaging plants or moving them indoors. With 1,000-watt bulbs and hydroponic systems, it is now possible, if not yet commonplace, to find ''lighthouses'' in such places as Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and even midtown Manhattan. As cultivation moves indoors and becomes more urban, the chance of penetration by organized crime increases. Through its foreign drug policies, the Government may have created its own worst nightmare: a distinctly American phenomenon increasingly vulnerable to criminal syndicates - in effect, a Prohibition situation. The suggestion by Mayor Koch of New York that Army troops be deployed on the nation's borders is already outmoded, at least for marijuana. At the same time, old arguments are being taken away from antimarijuana ideologues. Marijuana can no longer easily be viewed as a corrupter of youth, since the high cost of domestic marijuana, about $250 an ounce at retail, has priced teen-agers out of the market. Teen-agers' use has fallen 40 percent in the last few years, while adults' use (nine out of 10 marijuana smokers are adults) is increasing. Health studies usually debunk the myths of permanent damage to reproductive organs or the brain. And out in the heartland, in regions where marijuana now generates more money than timber, grapes, okra or tourism, the crop is beginning to generate a farm lobby like any other. Right now, there is a backlash against domestic cultivation. But as the Government begins to apply tactics usually reserved for dirty wars in foreign lands, there may be a backlash to the backlash. Those who have regarded marijuana smoking as no more a sin than driving 60 miles per hour in a 55 m.p.h. zone are being told they are criminals, for the first time since the middle 1970's, when decriminalization became policy in major states. It would be foolish to expect a major change in Federal marijuana policy. For now, marijuana remains linked to heroin, even though most junkies begin their addictive behavior on beer, and few, if any, apartments have been burglarized or joggers mugged for marijuana money. Still, thanks to the Government's own policies, pressure for legalizing marijuana is building faster than one would have thought five year's ago.",A MYOPIC APPROACH TO MARIJUANA,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/09/opinion/a-myopic-approach-to-marijuana.html

Interspersed among the heartfelt letters of all elements of the generation might be such relics as the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, a sharpened bamboo stake, a Westmoreland troop request, a Zippo lighter, a stone from the Hue Citadel, a lottery number, a remnant of a fuselage, a sign from the ''Hanoi Hilton'' (a P.O.W. camp), a Medal of Honor citation, a shroud from a Buddhist monk's robe, a marijuana pipe, a national service ribbon, a leaflet from the protest of 500,000, Jimmy Carter's pardon declaration.

But the meeting was dealt an immediate setback when it became known that the oil minister of Nigeria, which unilaterally lowered its oil price last week, would not take part. (Page A1, Column 1.)

Campaign officials for both sides said the 90-minute debate had set the stage for two weeks of hard fighting on the leadership issue. (A1:6.) Denials that the Pentagon or the Joint Chiefs of Staff had recommended that the marines in Beirut be withdrawn five days before a terrorist attack there killed 241 Americans were issued by the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department. The denials were issued in response to a charge made by Walter F. Mondale in the debate with President Reagan that Mr. Reagan disregarded a plea from the Joint Chiefs to remove the marines from the barracks at Beirut airport. (A1:3-4.) President Reagan was disputed by C.I.A. officials. They told two Senators that no copies of the agency's manual on guerrilla warfare were edited to remove advice on kidnapping and killing Nicaraguan Government officials and other material that is in violation of policy. (A1:5.) President Reagan's comments on Philipine politics were assailed by opposition leaders in Manila who said they showed he had badly misread the situation. An opposition legislator, Ramon Mitra, said the main opposition to the Government of President Ferdinand E. Marcos was not Communist, as Mr. Reagan said, but democratic. But, Mr. Mitra added, ''if there is one thing that may lead to Communism here, it is Marcos staying in power.'' (A3:4-6.) The Navy's use of old ammunition was in part responsible for the poor results last year of shelling off Lebanon by the battleship New Jersey, according to an expert. Comdr. Richard Gano, chief weapons officer of the New Jersey's sister ship, the Iowa, said no ammunition for their 16-inch guns had been made since the Korean War, with some rounds dating to World War II. (A15:1-3.) Lack of concern over workers' health was laid to the Reagan Administration by Ralph Nader, the consumer activist. He accused the Administration of a ''cruel coverup'' for failing to notify more than 200,000 workers identified in Government studies that they faced increased health risks from exposure to toxic substances in the workplace. (A19:1-3.) The Reagan Presidency has altered the tone and texture of Government by shifting the focus of political debate from solving social problems to cutting budgets and narrowing Federal activities. Local politicians no longer look to Washington for new initiatives and funding. (A26:1-4.) 25 ''exceptionally talented'' people will receive MacArthur Foundation prizes ranging from $176,000 to $300,000 over five years. For the first time, the newest fellows include a currently performing artist - Bill Irwin, an actor and mime who is appearing in a farce, ''The Accidental Death of an Anarchist.'' (A14:1-3.) Illegal marijuana cultivation has generated increasing violence and made some of the nation's most scenic and remote wilderness areas unsafe, according to law-enforcement officials. They said that at least four murders related to marijuana growing have occurred this fall in the lush, redwood-clad counties of northern California. (A14:1-2.) Metropolitan Heavy drinking by teen-agers was confirmed in a New York State survey. One of every 10 high school and junior high school students described themselves as ''hooked'' on alcohol and said they got drunk at least once a week, and 13 percent said they attended classes while drunk. (A1:1-3.) Delays in processing new voter cards were reported by the New York City Board of Elections. The board said it had not yet finished processing 90,000 applications but expressed confidence that no one would be improperly barred from voting. However, Norman Adler, the head of a nonpartisan registration drive, predicted near chaos at the polls. (A1:2.) Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Mary V. Mochary, the former Mayor of Montclair, who is his Republican challenger, expressed sharp disagreements on economic policy and on the Reagan Administration's actions in Nicaragua in a campaign debate at The New York Times. (A1:4-6.) Geraldine A. Ferraro came home to Queens, her right cheek smudged with lipstick from all the kisses she received along Steinway Street. The Democratic Vice Presidential nominee grasped outstretched hands, held babies and hugged longtime political backers.

For the woman writer, ''the group'' is a kind of interior quest, a portrait of the artist as several different young selves - contrasting, perhaps warring, images that are ghosts of her adult destiny. She exorcises them by giving each self her own life.

The young man, now tall, thin and gray, says, ''By God! I wouldn't have recognized you, you've got so, so -'' '' 'Thin?' Megan helps him out. But perhaps he has not meant simply thin? Had he, conceivably, meant beautiful, or rich? Very likely not - just thin.''",LIFE AFTER RADCLIFF,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/books/life-after-radcliff.html

The novel is rather about the severity of America's class system and the futility of outsiders' dreams. Rich, poor, fat, thin - even, perhaps especially, superior - women are outsiders.

Chapters full of conversation, a rapid unfolding of conflict and a short time span make Ray Locke's second novel seem more a play than a novel. Set in a small Mississippi town in 1954, ''Seldom Sung Songs'' chronicles one day in the life of the Kantwiths, a patriarchal, land-poor, once aristocratic family. It is no ordinary day, however; the catalyst for the novel's development is the return of the body of the eldest son, killed two years before in Korea. The setting provides an effective microcosm of the South prior to the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision ending public school segregation. We see the ambiguous and complex interaction of the white and black worlds: how two women, one white, the other black, can privately be best of friends yet occupy different spheres of society; the taboos and hypocrisy of a social class unwilling to regognize that it no longer holds the elevated position it once did; the way a young black man of intelligence and promise can be forever banished from his hometown for insulting a white man.

The title of this first novel is taken from the opening sentence of George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty- Four,'' and, in 1985, the central character, Gina Baldwin, is writing a doctoral thesis on Orwell. She becomes so obsessed with her subject that she goes to live on the desolate British island of Jura, renting the house in which Orwell actually wrote ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.'' While Gina is hunting deer with an islander who knew the writer during his last years, an attempt is made on her life and her manuscript is stolen from the house. Meanwhile, on a fishing boat in the Caribbean, Victor Gore, the dictatorial head of Tropic American, a powerful corporation, tells his associates that he plans to install an interactive cable system called the R-Tube in Washington. Big Brother, of course. Victor, a crony of the President who is soon to be appointed Secretary of Defense, suddenly decides to have his next board meeting on Jura and sends two of his closest aides to check the island out. What is at stake, and the novel hardly conceals it and thus loses its tension almost immediately, is Victor's fear that Gina's research will reveal his past as a Communist and his membership in the Lincoln Brigade and the Soviet N.K.V.D. during the Spanish Civil War. Along the way, lost papers of Orwell recovered from a cave record among other things a hilarious Indian arm-wrestling match between Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, which, I am happy to report, Orwell wins hands down. Thurston Clarke, to his credit, has done his research well and knows how to differentiate the bloody machinations of the Communists during the Spanish Civil War from the romantic nonsense peddled by too many historians. ''Thirteen O'clock'' could have been an intriguing suspense novel; unfortunately, every time the reader becomes interested in one element of the plot, he is joltingly shunted over to another.

''First Among Equals'' follows the ups and downs of the political lives of three Englishmen, each of whom believes himself destined to become Prime Minister - Charles Hampton, the son of an aristocratic family; Raymond Gould, a brilliant and uncompromising intellectual, loyal to the interests of the working class to which he belongs; and Simon Kerslake, a gadfly politician building his reputation on persistent and sometimes over-eager interrogations from the backbench of Parliament. We follow their careers through ascending stations of government, as Jeffrey Archer laces his narrative with brief, dutifully placed episodes of adultery, blackmail and terrorism - all set against a backdrop of the threat of national economic collapse. At the center of his story, however, is the volatile nature of the English parliamentary system. Each time the ruling party, Conservative or Labor, suffers a crisis of ''no confidence,'' new elections are held. In the subsequent reapportioning of Cabinet ministers and party appointments, Mr. Archer's characters move closer to the top of the political deck. Unfortunately, the author's experience as a member of Parliament from 1969 to 1974 has failed to inform his imagination as a novelist. He approaches his subject with a kind of bowed reverence, and the novel is dominated by starched, jounalistic observations of proceedings within the claustrophic chamber of the House of Commons. The plot is prodded along by nuances of parliamentary procedure and a series of formalistic - not to mention formulaic - contrivances. It is only in the last 10 pages, when the characters' conflicting destinies finally escalate to threaten the foundation of the English monarchy that the book attains some excitement. - M. S.

Set in Elspeth, Ohio, in 1913, Helen Faye Rosenblum's second novel, ''Descending Order,'' revolves around Olivia Nicholson, an overly eager, overly irritating 13-year-old suffering from adolescent growing pains. Basically, Olivia is in a love-hate relationship with the world - with her brother, Sylvan, a doctor; with her mother, Selena, an unusually (considering the times) career-oriented book indexer; with her neighbor Stella (who puts red shoe polish in her hair and calls herself ''Azimuth''); with her haughty teacher, Miss Ealing; and with her sometime boyfriend Cletus. To kill time, Olivia systematically memorizes the encyclopedia, brews cinnamon tea and waits for something to happen. ''If life had punctuation marks,'' Miss Rosenblum writes, Olivia's life ''was fraught with periods and questions. She craved some exclamation points.'' What excitement does come along is often forced and uninspired. Among the burning questions: Will Olivia befriend Stella? Will Selena find another snake in the bathroom? Will the town that condemns Sylvan for an indecent act find he is innocent? Will someone - and this is the one that most occupies Olivia - come to the front door and find the doorbell not working? The answer to all questions is no. What does happen is that Olivia grows up, becomes a teacher and one day discovers the unexpected truth about her past. By waving everyone's dirty laundry in the air at the last minute, Miss Rosenblum attempts to resuscitate a weak and rapidly sagging plot line. Too late. The effect, rather than climactic, is sorely disappointing.

In ''Southern Women,'' Lois Battle, author of the best seller ''War Brides,'' depicts three generations of Southern women represented by the female line of a prominent Savannah family. Eunnonia Grace Hampton, known as Nonnie, is matriarch of the clan; over 70 when widowhood permits her her first real independence, she is now, at 83, a vital force in local real estate and a woman of enlightened social views. Lucille Hampton Simpkins, her youngest daughter, has devoted her life to cultivating those traditional feminine charms that only fleetingly satisfy her vanity and leave her vulnerable at 50 to a consummate roue. Lucille's daughter, Cordy, 30, wants more from life than her marital bed can provide, and has become a romance novelist. The book begins when Cordy, after leaving Chicago and her husband, returns home to Savannah. Soon she has the chance to spend a month or more alone in New York, and Nonnie urges her, ''Do somethin' better. An' for more money.'' By the end, several months and 300 pages later, Cordy has both done and become something better. She's coped with loneliness in Manhattan; she's completed and sold an ambitious work of biography; she's divorced her husband and entered a mutually respectful relationship with the man who has always loved her. There are elements of soap opera here, as well as a clear feminist theme - simply, fulfillment comes from being one's own person, not someone else's.

To the ancient Greeks, Orpheus' name was synonymous with the enchantment of poetry; animals and rivers stopped to hear him, and his song freed his wife from the chains of Hades. But he was the odd man out in Greek culture; he does not fit into any of the genealogies of mythic heroes in Greece or the principal outside cultures that fed Greek myth. Yet for more than 1,200 years, up to the sixth century A.D., religious poems attributed to Orpheus, especially the great narratives about the generation of the gods and the creation of the universe, were the foundations of popular Greek religion. Fragments and summaries are scattered throughout the works of philosophers, historians and poets - so many pieces from so many times and places, filled with contradictions, that most scholars have avoided trying to discover any order in them. Among the few who have tried, the cost in damaged reputations has been high. In 1962 a fourth-century B.C. papyrus roll was found in Greece containing part of a long commentary on an Orphic poem about the gods' origins and quotations from the poem. The text has not yet been published, but M. L. West, a professor of Greek at the University of London, has used it, along with his enormous and confident learning, and common sense, to untangle the broken, looped and knotted history of the Orphic poems. His exposition is convincing, although other scholars undoubtedly will dispute him on many points. And his command of the entire literature is complete; all the evidence one needs to take any position in the debate is in this book. It is hardly for the uninitiated and certainly not for the Greekless, but anyone who wants to see how a master can candidly and skillfully bring philology, linguistics, anthropology, theology, history, archeology and clear, close reasoning to bear on a maddeningly fugitive problem will find ''The Orphic Poems'' a delightful revelation.

Xenia, Miss Santmyer's hometown, is also the setting of ''Ohio Town,'' a rich but sometimes tedious amalgam of history and memoir. The book is best read not at one sitting but chapter by chapter - ''The Courthouse,'' ''The Library,'' ''The Cemetery'' - on Sunday afternoons, a time that in early 20th-century Xenia was ''still intolerably dull - desert intervals spaced regularly along a road through country otherwise rich in diversion.'' Miss Santmyer writes lovingly of an era when the important business of life was conducted on the front porches of well-tended houses on Church and North Detroit Streets and when one waited an entire morning to buy a spool of thread from a particular clerk at the local clothing and dry-goods store to avoid hurting her delicate feelings. While ''Ohio Town'' captures the textures of a bygone era, it also reveals the era's narrow-mindedness. ''No white family which considered itself respectable would live next door to a colored family,'' Miss Santmyer writes. She also notes, ''We were fond of (blacks), and laughed at them, feeling that their rich comicality added to the color of life in the town.''

In ''False Dawn,'' the prolific author Louis Auchincloss discusses briefly the lives of 15 women who lived during the 17th-century reign of Louis XIV. The women, only half of whom are French, are examined in the shadow of the Sun King, who, Mr. Auchincloss writes, ''for better or worse . . . dominated Europe'' throughout his reign. With the exception of his essay on Mme. de Sevigne, Mr. Auchincloss does his best job when he crosses the English Channel. His portraits of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne are very good indeed, and his analysis of the rivalry between the Duchess of Marlborough and the servant Abigail Hill, later Lady Masham, to curry favor with Queen Anne is most interesting. At times Mr. Auchincloss seeks to rescue or at least recast some of the women's reputations, but these efforts can't be fully effective in such brief sketches. He argues that despite the age's chauvinism, it produced an unusual number of women of accomplishment. But the age was a ''false dawn'' because these gains were lost during the next century. This theory is interesting, but, for the most part, the women Mr. Auchincloss considers are not typical. If most of them had ''not been born high in the social scale they would never have been heard from,'' he writes. Every age has its heroines and its disappointments.

(Yale University, $22.50) Largely using studies he and his colleagues published in the 1970's, Norman E. Zinberg, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University, analyzes the relationships among the pharmacological properties of illicit drugs, the psychological makeup (''set'') of their users and, especially, the effect on consumption of informal social controls, or rites and rituals of use (''setting''). Mr. Zinberg entices the reader by preaching that ''individuals who either do not use intoxicants or who use them only infrequently in order to keep up with their friends often fail to recognize that others may benefit from regular, controlled use because it brings them relaxation and a sense of freedom from inhibition.'' Mr. Zinberg classifies his 135 users of marijuana, psychedelics or opiates as compulsive, marginal or controlled. Not surprisingly, all the marijuana and psychedelic users were ''controlled'' rather than ''compulsive'' users, since neither category of drugs, unlike opiates, is physically addicting. Of the 98 opiate (mainly heroin) users who form the bulk of the study, 61 were designated as controlled. But their case histories raise doubts about the legitimacy of this classification; few of Mr. Zinberg's controlled opiate users are employed full time; 66 percent use marijuana from twice to several times a week; 22 percent use cocaine from once a month to twice a week; 36 percent drink alcohol once or twice a day; 83 percent smoke tobacco daily. Also, half had previously been addicted to opiates one or more times; since there was only one follow-up interview, one wonders how many have become addicted again. Most seriously, ''Drug, Set, and Setting'' fails to consider what the odds are of avoiding addiction after starting to use a highly addictive drug like heroin. A 1967 study of young black males in St. Louis found that of the 13 percent who had tried heroin, 77 percent of them had become addicts, and no one using the drug more than six times had avoided addiction.

One of the murders Mr. Cartwright recounts is that of a Federal judge, an assassination that lead to the costliest F.B.I. investigation ever. This murder piques our interest, but Mr. Cartwright does not make it the focus of ''Dirty Dealing.'' Nor does he focus entirely on the Chagra family, whose ethos is exemplified by one member's ''affinity for cards and dice, for dope dealers and shady politicians and nightclub singers, for dabblers in the black market and exponents of the fast buck.'' Instead, he inundates us with a flood of unprocessed information. Law enforcement officials, drug dealers and Texas politicians may appreciate this jumble of backroom deals, undercover surveillance and courtroom politics, but it is too much for the average reader to follow without the author's guidance. In the end, after the death of Lee Chagra and the incarceration of his two younger brothers, the three are depicted as tragic heroes.

There is a lot of talk in law schools and history classes about the Constitution's being a living document, but it's not always clear what that means. Certainly, most of the books on the subject are as dead as the founding fathers. So it is all the more remarkable that Fred W. Friendly and Martha J. H. Elliott have produced such a vivid history of how the Supreme Court has expanded our constitutional rights. In 16 case studies on such timely issues as school prayer, affirmative action, the death penalty, freedom of the press and immigration policy, ''The Constitution'' conveys both the passion of the social policy debate and the legal principles the Supreme Court applied - and in the process passes on gossipy tidbits on everything from Katharine Hepburn's mother's role in promoting birth control to George Westinghouse's worry that the image of his new electric generators would be sullied if they were used to electrocute criminals. Even some of the more arcane problems that plague law students - such as the process by which the Bill of Rights was found to bind not only the Federal Government but the states - are handled so deftly that the most convoluted, long-since-overturned Supreme Court rulings become lucid markers of the evolution of constitutional history.

Business blossomed after World War II; America discovered Hawaii, and Hollywood soon discovered the Hawaiian shirt, as the photographs here attest. There is a ''star decal'' of the youthful Tony Curtis in a Hawaiian shirt, and Montgomery Clift dies in one in ''From Here to Eternity.'' Ida Lupino and Dorothy Lamour recline in sarongs because the shirts were considered too ''blousy'' for women then, Mr. Steele notes. (But Ann Sheridan looks smashing in her blazer and Hawaiian shirt ensemble.) The Hawaiian shirt also made it to the White House; a 1951 Life magazine cover shows Harry Truman resplendent in his ''seashore shirt with seagulls.'' But the increasing popularity of the shirt was the beginning of its end. The Hawaiian shirt is now a lost art, done in by mass production, mechanized patterns, mainland imitations and, Mr. Steele mourns, polyester. - Wendy Kaminer",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/16/books/in-short-213351.html

Shultz said, but he ruled out a Soviet proposal for a freeze of such tests in advance of actual negotiations. Previously, the Reagan Administration had said it was willing to engage in talks with Moscow on curbing the militarization of outer space so long as there were no conditions. The United States had not specifically addressed itself publicly to the moratorium question. (Page A1, Column 4.) Jamaica is a heavy contributor to the worsening American drug problem despite its position as one of the closest political allies of the United States. In the face of Congressional threats to cut off millions in economic aid, Jamaica has steadily been producing large amounts of marijuana for export to the United States. It is also increasingly being used as a base for transshipping cocaine from South America, United States officials say.

In the foreword to this nearly 1,000-page anthology, the editor Alberto Manguel defines ''fantastic literature'' as ''the impossible seeping into the possible, what Wallace Stevens calls 'black water breaking into reality.' '' This broad definition allows Mr. Manguel to include everything from the ecstatic animism of Cynthia Ozick's ''The Pagan Rabbi'' to the visceral horror of Poe's ''The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.'' Especially welcome is the generous selection of fiction from Latin America, the current capital of the fantastic. The lead story is the late Julio Cortazar's ''House Taken Over,'' a brilliantly deadpan haunted house tale; also outstanding are Horacio Quiroga's ''The Feather Pillow,'' a bloodcurdling monster story, and Virgilio Pinera's ''Insomnia,'' a tour de force about the relationship between sleep and death. A number of the more ghostly pieces are from neglected British masters: It is good to have L. P. Hartley's ''A Visitor From Down Under'' back in print, a story featuring a frozen ghost who delivers chills that are quite literal; an equally superb choice is Walter de la Mare's hauntingly ambiguous ''Seaton's Aunt,'' which does for the traditional vampire tale what ''The Turn of the Screw'' did for the traditional ghost story.

(Simon & Schuster, $19.95) Once again, Susan Howatch is rattling the bones in the closets of Britain, this time at Oxmoon, the Welsh estate of the Godwins, an Anglo-Welsh family whose lineage reaches to the days of William the Conquerer. In 1913, when this generational saga begins, Robert Godwin has only just started to restore a family fortune much diminished by his profligate father. Robert's widowed mother is left to guide the moral development of her five children. Wielding Victorian precepts like a sword, she ''draws the line'' against any passion that may threaten to invade their lives. The children oblige by becoming as priggish as possible, a misfortune for child and reader alike, since Miss Howatch has chosen to subdue her own narrative voice and relate this tale in the voices of the children and grandchildren. Robert, the eldest son, is the first to explain his parents' need for conformity and respectability: Their recent past was riven with ''Sodomy, adultery and murder; robbery, madness and lust,'' a heritage their children will not easily escape. In time, they too, will encounter murder and madness as they vie for ownership of Oxmoon. If their struggles seem lacking in drama, it is because too many of the book's major events are reported after the fact; thus the story is robbed of color and immediacy. This is partially compensated for by the thorough re-creation of a distant place and time. Finally, we may not care whether the Godwin grandson can redeem himself or his family in the late 1960's (he does). But we are not likely to forget details such as the moment when Robert's valet presents him with his morning copy of The Times, neatly ironed. -- Barbara Helfgott",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

The wondrous quality of joyous digging in language and intellectual play that permeates Frederick Ted Castle's first novel is half the story. Or, rather, it is the only story in ''Anticipation,'' a novel in which everything that happened to Mr. Castle in the year 1963 is put down in brilliant, funny and parodistic turns. Mr. Castle's novel has a tradition - it stems from the discursiveness of Laurence Sterne (it apes ''Tristam Shandy'' in substituting photographs for blank pages) and James Joyce (it pays allegiance to ''Ulysses'' in its parodies of early literature and contemporary antinovels and high - or low - romance). For extra measure, there are diagrams, letters and notes in poor handwriting, as well as long passages of undistinguished elementary French. But, unlike Sterne and Joyce, and even the French antinovels of the 1960's, ''Anticipation'' lacks a real narrative. For some readers the unity of a writer's brilliant wandering thoughts on the human condition - and especially his own - may prove enough compensation; Mr. Castle is extravagant in spending his talents of wit and invidious humor in this provocatively experimental novel in which everything happens in the mind. Still, others will insist that Mr. Castle's previous neglect is justified. (He wrote this novel in the mid-1960's.) ''Anticipation'' will become an addiction for a few and a throwaway for others, yet it will last. It is a presence one wants to have around, but its waywardness excludes it from mainstream literature. It has everything but a center; it is a magnificent sideshow. -- Martin Tucker",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

To the North American mind, Mexico has always seemed a blend of the exotic and the squalid. ''Such barbarous names, such barbarous places,'' broods a character in Ernest Brawley's third novel. ''The Alamo Tree'' serves up this blend in the form of a family chronicle. Named after a relative of the American elm, the alamo is a sacred tree that crops up in the story as a sort of all-purpose symbol for the family. The book tracks the rise and fall of three intertwined families' fortunes. The O'Hares, transplanted Irish-Americans, are behind a resort hotel boom in Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta. The Carrizos, native-born mestizos, rise from the peasantry to become corrupt public officials who fatten upon ''la mordida,'' the little bite. The Martinezes, swamp-dwelling Indians, are shrimp fishermen until they become involved in the cultivation and export of marijuana. Thus Mr. Brawley, ''a Californian from an Anglo-Mexican family,'' has peopled his novel with representative types, examples of Mexico's three classes - the rich, the poor and the foreign born. ''The Alamo Tree'' could almost double as a social history of Mexico between the administrations of Plutarco Elias Calles (1924-1928) and Jose Lopez Portillo (1978-1982). But Mr. Brawley is not really a social historian; he discerns no pattern or principle within the Mexican experience. He has chosen to write about this period in Mexico and these characters for the same reason he has chosen to write a family chronicle. Both the subject and the form are loose enough to allow a number of alternating stories - sexy, adventurous, magical - without demanding the logic of plot or message.-- D. G.

In only 10 years of writing and with more than 100 million copies of her books in print worldwide, Janet Dailey is easily one of America's best-selling authors. ''Silver Wings, Santiago Blue,'' like its predecessors, combines romance and adventure - there is risk to life, limb and, especially, heart - but is rooted in historical fact. For a brief period during World War II the United States Air Force used female volunteer pilots, who became known as WASPS (Women Airforce Service Corps) and eventually wore uniforms of ''Santiago blue.'' Begun in late 1942, when the Allied air situation seemed dire, the program was terminated two years later, after the House of Representatives refused the WASPS a military commission. In the interim, the women were trained to ferry airplanes from point to point, tow targets for gunnery and artillery practice, and perform other needed and dangerous noncombat duties. This tale focuses on five young heroines, women sharing a section of barracks, as well as a love for airplanes and the need to prove their competence to men convinced ''it ain't natural'' for women to fly. They are Cappy Hayward, an Army brat; the sexually liberated Marty Rogers; Mary Lynn Palmer, a Southern innocent; Eden van Valkenburg, from New York's upper crust; and the Jewish Rachel Goldman. The best scenes involve flying, its techniques and procedures, and the feelings it inspires (the author is herself an amateur pilot). On the ground, the main characters fall in love or lust, but there is little emotional development, for they are essentially one-dimensional. The prose is purple, not always grammatical: ''Swallowing the hot rush of temper''; ''Eden prowled the room like a cage-crazy tigress''; ''All six of them invaded the shop, splitting to go down the aisles.'' The idea of a novel about women pilots is interesting, but the book disappoints. -- Miriam Berkley NONFICTION",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

''The Spot'' is a careful history of political commercials, showing that despite all the claims of innovation and brilliance with which producers surround their spots, what will be aired this fall is evolutionary, not revolutionary. As the Reagan campaign spatters the airwaves with television commercials that look like those from an investment house and proclaim that everything in America is wonderful, another campaign comes to mind. In 1956, President Eisenhower's campaign for the first time went beyond just straight speeches into the television camera and showed such proofs of success as housewives in the kitchen with new appliances. And as the Democrats try to make corruption and unfairness charges stick to the Reagan Administration, the negative political commercials invented in 1956 will have their descendants on the air too. Edwin Diamond, who heads the News Study Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stephen Bates, a media researcher at the Institute of Politics at Harvard, examine famous political broadcasts - from Richard Nixon's Checkers speech in 1960 to Lyndon Johnson's ''daisy'' commercial in 1964 - and with the less remembered elements of campaigns before and since. They carefully trace, and usefully illustrate, the history of the ''polispot,'' as they call the political spot advertisement. But the major disappointment of this book is that it enumerates but does not analyze. The last chapter is spent raising, though rarely answering, questions about the effect of television commercials on politics in America. What the authors have done is excellent spadework for other analysts who will offer bolder conclusions than their own: ''In the end, we are willing to leave the polispots and the media campaigns to the knowing judgment of the audience."" -- Adam Clymer",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

After winning independence, the new American Republic simply dispensed with its Navy because of its cost and because of fears of dangerous foreign entanglements. This proved to be a short-sighted decision, as William M. Fowler Jr., a professor of history at Northeastern University, shows in ''Jack Tars and Commodores,'' a well-researched early history of the American Navy and of the political maneuvering that led to its re-creation. After the Revolution, American shipping was regularly preyed upon with impunity by the British, the French and the states of the Barbary Coast. The outraged American Government could do nothing to aid its citizens whose ships and crews were being seized. In 1793, Congress reluctantly voted to build six frigates. In 1794, France and the United States drifted into the so-called Quasi War (a series of hostilities that lasted until 1800). The American fleet, finally launched in 1797, successfully protected American trade in the West Indies and won several battles with French warships. After the Quasi War, the Barbary states, especially Tripoli, began seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. In 1801, President Jefferson dispatched the fleet, and despite some incompetent commanders and the loss of the frigate Philadelphia, the Navy eventually stopped the depredations of the Barbary states. During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain constantly violated American neutrality by impressing American seamen into the Royal Navy. So, in 1812, an angry Congress declared war. To the surprise of the Royal Navy, the American fleet quickly won a series of victories, and when the Americans won control of the Great Lakes, a British invasion from Canada was prevented. The achievements of the American Navy in its first three decades splendidly vindicated those who had argued for its re-creation. -- Ronald Bailey",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

David Daiches, the renowned critic and literary historian, was invited to present these lectures at Edinburgh University in 1983. In them, he examines how various poets, from biblical times to the present, have struggled with, celebrated and communicated their belief (and nonbelief) in God in their poetry. The scope of ''God and the Poets'' is remarkably extensive, and Mr. Daiches manages to include original and perceptive interpretations of the Book of Job and medieval Hebrew poetry, as well as of the poetry of Milton, Robert Burns, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens and Edwin Muir, among many others. In the final chapter, ''Poetry and Belief,'' he explores the many reasons why readers of poetry can be so profoundly moved by the religious (or atheistic) works of poets whose beliefs they may not share, or may even vigorously oppose. These lectures offer much pleasure to the reader by providing specific (and often surprising) insights into the works of individual poets, as well as a historical overview of God's significant place in poetry through the ages.

For half a century after the First Crusade (1095-1099) had established Frankish states in Palestine, the Islamic world was too divided to mount a war against the Christians. A Kurd named Saladin finally drew the Moslems of the Fertile Crescent together to reclaim much of their land. Dante, Sir Walter Scott and other Westerners glorified this Moslem leader's fairness, even generosity, in battle, fascinated by what they saw as Christian virtues in a heathen. Later writers debunked this myth of a selfless hero, declaring Saladin's motivation to be personal ambition. Now, in ''Saladin in His Time,'' the historian P. H. Newby, argues that Saladin ''served his own interests, while serving the interests of Islam as a whole.'' Mr. Newby states that Saladin's shrewd politicking was necessary to unify Islam and that only a unified Islam could successfully oppose the Christians. Thus Saladin's first campaigns were against fellow Moslems. This internecine fighting and Saladin's aversion to plundering and killing when not militarily warranted contravened the warrior code of the era, disgruntling his brethren and surprising his foes. Saladin's generosity, Mr. Newby suggests, partly accounts for his minor stature among the heroes of Islam, and for this reason, his exploits did not earn a place in ''The Arabian Nights.'' But it is a delight that Mr. Newby has resurrected the tale of a man who won the admiration of his enemies. - Linda Robinson",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

Can the superpowers ever achieve real detente? Or was the brief period of seeming cooperation they enjoyed in the early 1970's merely an illusory interlude, unlikely ever to be repeated? These are the questions that Harry Gelman, a senior staff member in the political science department of the Rand Corporation, poses in ''The Brezhnev Politburo and the Decline of Detente.'' His answers, based on a detailed examination of how the Politburo made foreign policy in the 70's, amount to a grimly pessimistic vision of continued and unstinting rivalry. On the apparent equilibrium of the early 1970's, he quotes a prominent Soviet bureaucrat quoting Marx: ''In politics you may conclude alliances with the Devil himself if you are certain that you can cheat the Devil.'' To explain the decline of detente, Mr. Gelman shows how the bitter jockeying for power that goes on inside the Kremlin has helped push the leadership toward a more hard-line and adventurous foreign policy. He also paints a dark psychological portrait of the top Soviet leaders' deeply defensive attitudes, their ''compulsion to attack'' the United States and their driving need to shore up their own legitimacy by both ideological and military conquest. As for the future, he sees scant hope that the Kremlin will abandon its efforts to win what he suggests it sees as an everlasting ''zero- sum'' game. How does Mr. Gelman know what he knows? It is often hard to tell. He is careful, even painstaking in his analysis, but he does sometimes seem to strain to make his points, arguing from spotty evidence and relying heavily on his own assertion that the men in the Politburo will not be happy until they have ''supplanted'' the United States. His last, predictive chapter seems particularly vulnerable, an airless projection of the present onto the future that leaves virtually no room for chance or change or effective American policy. In this, Mr. Gelman sometimes seems the captive of his own bleak vision. He has, nevertheless, in his sober, scholarly way, drawn a vivid and deeply troubling picture of the way the Soviets think. - Tamar Jacoby",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

Kilpatrick, a syndicated political columnist, says that his purpose is ''to venture a few suggestions, based on a lifetime as a writer, on how good writers can get to be better writers,'' and most of his tips are clearheaded and sound. One wonders, however, whether ''Keep it simple,'' ''Have something to say'' and ''Take your time'' really tell anyone anything new about writing well. But when Mr. Kilpatrick ventures into the subject of cadence and the importance of the way words sound, my interest perks up. As he writes, ''We ought never to be embarrassed, in the privacy of our chambers, to 'sound out' a sentence.'' Hear, hear! He tells aspiring and accomplished writers alike to ''Write verse. It is the finest discipline ever devised for writers who would hone their skills with language.'' But he disappoints when he adds, ''Mind you, I'm not talking about free verse. It was Robert Frost who once defined free verse as playing tennis with the net down.'' Mr. Kilpatrick is more kindhearted when he shares the discoveries he has made in a wide range of sources. We learn, for example, that ''exosculate'' means ''to kiss heartily.'' And a sentence from the offices of I.B.M. - ''Meetings on equipment acceptance provide a severe test of our synchronized organizational parallel reciprocal monitored time-phased capability'' - makes the advice to keep it simple shine anew. - Andy Brumer Dishonored Prophets",IN SHORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/26/books/in-short-151605.html

And it generalizes to contend that school officials should be able to search a student without a warrant when they have a ''reasonable suspicion'' that school rules are being violated. That's a looser standard than the criminal law's ''probable cause.'' But the Justice Department reasons that a school search is ''the paradigm of the noncriminal investigation'' and should not be burdened with the higher standard that applies to the police. And the Supreme Court may well agree; it has often set reasonable limits on the constitutional rights of students. The Administration seems to be offering an acceptable balance between the school's duty to maintain order and a student's expectation of privacy. No learning can occur if school administrators cannot confiscate weapons, stop drug dealing or enforce reasonable rules without calling for the police and a criminal prosecution. They are to some degree parental authorities. But since criminal consequences may nonetheless flow from a school's invasions of privacy, its authority to search students should be well defined. This is a case where the Court should follow not the election returns but the appropriate standards of school behavior as expressed by local school boards, communities and parents.","Teacher's Right to Pry President Reagan scores a political strike whenever he calls for ''good, old-fashioned discipline'' in the nation's schools.

Drug gangs were blamed for the recent assassination of the minister of justice. Pakistan now estimates that it has more than 100,000 heroin addicts. Similar epidemics have struck Malaysia and Thailand. American ambassadors have therefore been able to negotiate drug eradication commitments with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Pakistan and Thailand. Similarly alarmed European governments are also showing more interest in the effort. Most notably, Italy has agreed to spend $40 million for reduction of Latin American coca. None of this has yet slowed the expansion of drug crops, and more forceful diplomacy may soon be in order. Bolivia suffered an embarrassing setback recently when it was revealed that U.S.- trained drug agents had joined a plot to overthrow the Government. The main channel for heroin now runs through Syria and Lebanon, whose Governments have not been approachable on the issue.

Suppose, without being too intelligent about it, that the contents of one's mind are mostly given, inherited like one's parents or the condition of growing up a Jewish boy in Brooklyn, or imposed by the circumstance of a war in the Pacific. Then, with talent to the degree of genius, it would be almost natural to write ''The Naked and the Dead,'' a novel in its main qualities naturalistic, close kin to Dreiser's fiction if locally responsive to Dos Passos's.

Such a mind would retain romanticism's self-assertion, not as a settled conviction but as a sporadic gesture of recalcitrance, representing the mind's refusal to coincide with its official character. Against the accepted force of circumstance and contingency, the mind would exert, intermittently, a force equal, opposite and correspondingly extreme; setting two admitted violences in combat. In those intermittences, the whole human story would amount to a man's will and what it opposes. Or to a sensed complicity between one's will and what Madden calls ''that strange will so external to myself,'' which drives him beyond any action his will would recognize as its chosen form. It would be natural for such a mind to give as much credence to ghosts as to bodies, to hallucinations as to verities, to dream play as to ratiocination. It would work as nonchalantly by improvising as by following the established procedures of cognition. So, in the new novel, Madden is thrown into a world of demonic combat, a frantic compound of ''that fiend who dwells in the sweet kundalini of our spine,'' otherwise named as ''the unmanageable in myself,'' recognized in sinister communion with ''the nearness of the Devil waiting to receive me'' and, succinctly for once, as ''something other.''",DEATH ON THE WINDY DUNES,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/books/death-on-the-windy-dunes.html

Madden, Mailer's surrogate in this respect, would offer a Keatsian justification for his violence, if the question were raised. Mailer would justify it further by seeing it as heroic resistance not only to evil at large but to the naturalism that demeans his energy. So a fight with thugs becomes ''the war.'' The justification is then developed as a particular style of exorbitance, not so much depicting reality as usurping it to enforce a transfigured sense of human possibility.

His theory would say that a sense of reality, in that conventional phrase, is merely a bad habit, and should be defeated by exerting nearly any violence upon it. But scorn, too, can be a bad habit when its gratifications are not earned.

Suppose, without being too intelligent about it, that the contents of one's mind are mostly given, inherited like one's parents or the condition of growing up a Jewish boy in Brooklyn, or imposed by the circumstance of a war in the Pacific. Then, with talent to the degree of genius, it would be almost natural to write ''The Naked and the Dead,'' a novel in its main qualities naturalistic, close kin to Dreiser's fiction if locally responsive to Dos Passos's.

Such a mind would retain romanticism's self-assertion, not as a settled conviction but as a sporadic gesture of recalcitrance, representing the mind's refusal to coincide with its official character. Against the accepted force of circumstance and contingency, the mind would exert, intermittently, a force equal, opposite and correspondingly extreme; setting two admitted violences in combat. In those intermittences, the whole human story would amount to a man's will and what it opposes. Or to a sensed complicity between one's will and what Madden calls ''that strange will so external to myself,'' which drives him beyond any action his will would recognize as its chosen form. It would be natural for such a mind to give as much credence to ghosts as to bodies, to hallucinations as to verities, to dream play as to ratiocination. It would work as nonchalantly by improvising as by following the established procedures of cognition. So, in the new novel, Madden is thrown into a world of demonic combat, a frantic compound of ''that fiend who dwells in the sweet kundalini of our spine,'' otherwise named as ''the unmanageable in myself,'' recognized in sinister communion with ''the nearness of the Devil waiting to receive me'' and, succinctly for once, as ''something other.''",Death on the Windy Dunes,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/books/death-on-the-windy-dunes.html

Mailer would justify it further by seeing it as heroic resistance not only to evil at large but to the naturalism that demeans his energy. So a fight with thugs becomes ''the war.'' The justification is then developed as a particular style of exorbitance, not so much depicting reality as usurping it to enforce a transfigured sense of human possibility.

By the time Charlie Barnet was a teen-ager, the big- band music that was to burst into real popularity during the 1930's was already in the air. Exactly why the grandson of the executive vice president of the New York Central Railroad became a musician is not clearly defined in Mr. Barnet's life story, but as he says, ''I found the idea of life on the road very intriguing . . . I probably was more enthralled with the life than the music - at first. '' He continued to enjoy the life, with its attendant whisky, marijuana and women - the title ''Those Swinging Years'' is definitely a double-entendre - but he also became heavily involved in the music, particularly that of Duke Ellington. Mr. Barnet, a saxophonist, began leading his own orchestra in 1933; as the band developed, it showed more and more affinity for the Ellington sound and style. His became one of the most swinging white bands and, indeed, one of the few to play Harlem's Apollo Theater, where it broke the house attendance record. Mr. Barnet was a pioneer in racially integrating his band, employing more black musicians than nearly all of the popular orchestras led by whites. The Barnet story, racier than most, even in a wild era, reveals much about the life of a traveling band. There are some hilarious escapades and memorable characters, like the late trumpeter Jack Purvis, with his penchant for getting into rough scrapes. Mr. Barnet talks frankly about such contemporaries as Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, but he is never meanspirited. He emerges as a man whose company one would enjoy. He comes down hard on bebop. ''Outside of top exponents,'' he says, ''like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and a few others, the boppers were a bunch of fumblers who were obviously incapable of handling the new idiom.'' Then he goes on to name all the people in his band of 1949 and tells you how good they were, thereby contradicting himself. But this could be the heavy English hand of his collaborator, Stanley Dance, an avowed hater of bop. ''Those Swinging Years'' should be of great interest to both those who lived through the big-band era and those who didn't and want to know what it was all about.

Of particular interest to players will be the blues chord progressions of Lonnie Johnson, Eddie Lang and Django Reinhardt. Further material on Reinhardt is culled from Charles Delaunay's book on the Belgian gypsy. Some of the guitarists covered are Charlie Christian, Oscar Moore, Charlie Byrd, John McLaughlin and Ralph Towner. The editor, James Sallis, writes about Eddie Lang, Herb Ellis, Howard Roberts, Jim Hall, Kenny Burrell, Joe Pass and Tal Farlow. The last six are grouped in a piece called ''Middle Ground,'' which is essentially a group of short takes. An evocative essay on Wes Montgomery comes from a liner note by the guitarist Steve Khan. In it Mr. Khan refers to his songwriter father but not by name. Mr. Sallis should have let people know that Steve was talking about Sammy Cahn. This is a somewhat uneven but usually interesting collection, particularly for working guitarists and student players. But any anthology on jazz guitar in which Jimmy Raney is mentioned only in passing has a big hole in it.",ALL THIS JAZZ,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/books/all-this-jazz.html

At issue in ''The Freedom Principle'' is whether one swallows whole everything that John Litweiler writes about the musicians who have contributed to the development of the body of music referred to over the past 25 years as ''the new thing,'' ''free jazz'' or just plain old ''avant-garde.'' As with the overwhelming majority of writers who espouse the ''outside,'' to use yet another of the music's designations, Mr. Litweiler is all praise, finding little fault and raising few points of contention about his subjects. The saxophonist Ornette Coleman's ''Harmolodic Theory,'' for instance, is explained only in the most simplistic terms, and it is never even hinted that improvisations using it can be as cliche-ridden as those employing the chords and melodies of previous periods. Additionally, Mr. Coleman's trumpet and violin technique is never questioned. Neither is the bad intonation of Von Freeman, the Chicago tenor saxophonist, or Sun Ra's sometimes incomprehensible performances of the works of Fletcher Henderson and Tadd Dameron. Whether this book has merit boils down to what one feels jazz is or should be. Mr. Litweiler does his best writing when he is talking about Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Once he gets away from these giants, he falls back on the kind of amorphous prose that became standard in art criticism with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, and his writing becomes as dry as a thesis on statistics. Unwittingly, the description of the music of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Bud Powell in the introductory chapter sets a musical standard that is so high that the freedom players Mr. Litweiler champions later have trouble measuring up. But if you agree that Bill Evans has an ''unremarkable melodic conception,'' dismiss Woody Herman as a ''mediocre eclectic'' and feel that the trumpeter Leo Smith's ''abstract mouthpiece and lip sounds'' and ''alive space'' and the alto saxophonist Anthony Braxton's ''distorted, nonconsecutive tones'' and ''growls and squalls'' are the way of today - and the future - then this book is for you.",ALL THIS JAZZ,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/books/all-this-jazz.html

Some are the chapter headings are ''Working,'' ''Who? And Where?,'' ''How?,'' ''Who With?,'' ''Why Not?'' and ''Why?'' In between the last two is a chapter entitled ''Lady,'' devoted to Billie Holiday. Most of the material is from interviews conducted by Miss Grime with a variety of singers, singer-musicians and accompanists. Comments from the record producers Milt Gabler and John Hammond are included. Twenty- three of the interviews used were drawn from previously published books, articles and album notes. Some of the participants in this sprawling symposium are Mose Allison, Chet Baker, Jackie Cain, Betty Carter, Rosemary Clooney, Dave Frishberg, Billy Eckstine, Slim Gaillard, Helen Humes, Abbey Lincoln, Helen Merrill, Annie Ross, Jimmy Rowles, Joe Williams, Jimmy Witherspoon and Trummy Young. Whether you read it in sequence or dip in at odd points along the way, ''Jazz Voices'' is fascinating. There is a vocabulary of musical terminology in the back, and the book is illustrated with 37 black-and-white photographs. I assume that writers and disk jockeys will want to avail themselves of the abundance of ready- made quotes. Here is Joe Williams: ''Singing is a thing you're compelled to do. And you can't help yourself. You look at the musicians, and you think, God, it will be fun to sing with them. And, in your mind you are already singing with them. You feel yourself doing this thing, you hear yourself. You do it before you do it.''",ALL THIS JAZZ,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/29/books/all-this-jazz.html

Paul Whiteman (1890-1967) has been much maligned as the ''King of Jazz'' but nevertheless was enormously important in the world of American music, particularly in the 1920's. This well-researched and entertaining biography describes the introduction of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' at Aeolian Hall in 1924 and Whiteman's commissioning of works from Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, William Grant Still, Ferde Grofe, Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky. It also enumerates the musicians and singers who passed through his orchestra, preparing for their own careers as they helped Whiteman maintain his high standards. Among them were Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, Red Norvo, Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael, Jack Teagarden, Bix Beiderbecke, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang. Lang died young, following a tonsillectomy, and the legendary Beiderbecke drank himself to death at 28. Otherwise they also would have gone on to even greater heights. Thomas A. DeLong draws a warts-and-all portrait of Pops, as Whiteman came to be known, beginning with his strained relationship with his mother and his father, the noted music educator Wilberforce Whiteman. Paul Whiteman's drinking, womanizing and phobias are all recounted here, but so is his overriding dedication to musical excellence. Whiteman raised the esteem of dance band musicians, paying them well and paving the way for their acceptance as serious musicians. The feeling of the 20's and 30's is captured in a seamless way, with the story serving as a primer on the development of radio, movies and recordings. Later, there are insights into the workings of early television. Whiteman was a true organizer and leader. Long after he gave up his band, these qualities were evident in his leisure pursuits such as sports-car racing and trapshooting. ''King of Jazz'' or not, whatever Paul Whiteman undertook he did it regally.

That concern reached its apogee in 1972 when George McGovern proposed a ''demo grant'' to guarantee every American $1,000 a year. The idea was instantly shouted down, even by Democrats. But less extreme concern for social welfare remained at the heart of the party's program. Social conscience endures this year - but it's not emphasized.","Democrats, Democrats and Plutocrats Two words echoed from the San Francisco convention last week: fairness and values.

Also, the enemy is not down, chiseling welfare and defrauding food stamps, but up, chiseling taxes and favoring plutocrats. Mr. Mondale says the rules are rigged. ''What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich.'' Mrs. Ferraro says ''it isn't right'' that the share of taxes paid by individuals is going up but the share paid by large corporations is going down. ''We're going to make the rules of American life work fairly for all Americans again.'' Hyperbole, to be sure, but slogans with clear policy implications when the time comes, for example, to raise taxes and cut subsidies. The same determination to reclaim the middle ground pervades the 1984 Democratic platform. It's windy and graceless. But it's centrist, a far cry from the 1972 party and program that were mocked for the ''three A's'': acid, abortion and amnesty. This platform condemns marijuana abuse. Instead of new social programs, it calls for ''restraining domestic expenditures.'' One must search to find discussion of welfare and food aid. Values, the other key word, denotes a related bundle of attitudes about flag, family, neighborhood, loyalty, decency. Geraldine Ferraro conveys a double appeal. As a woman, she projected electricity through the convention. As a child of immigrants who worked her way through school and a prosecutor who put her share of criminals in jail, she also personifies those values. The fairness tactic, running against plutocrats, may backfire. Ordinary people generally do not hate the rich but aspire to be like them. They may be more likely to draw the line between themselves and the people below rather than those above. But the appeal to values can't be wrong. They are not just the values of disaffected Democrats. They are everyone's values. If Candidates Mondale and Ferraro can identify with them, they'll have both their parties back and make a race of it yet.","Democrats, Democrats and Plutocrats Two words echoed from the San Francisco convention last week: fairness and values.

Dole requiring air bags or automatic seat belts on all new passenger automobiles sold in the United States in five years. (Later in the week, New York became the first state to enact a law requiring motorists in the front seats to wear seat belts, and all children under the age of 10 to wear belts or sit in safety seats.) The air bag decision was one the Administration wanted to avoid, some say, because these so-called passive restraints represent an especially intrusive instance of government protecting people from themselves. ''Something like this makes me think, for this we elected Ronald Reagan?'' said Walter Olson, associate editor of Regulation, a magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy research organization. ''This is an issue that sticks out like a sore thumb, because there's an element of people being protected against a hazard they knew they were facing. It's a pure form of paternalism.'' Democrats and some Republicans have long disagreed with that view. From air bags to drugs to motorcycle helmets, Presidents and Congress have held that the law must sometimes protect people against themselves. Steven Kelman, associate director of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, says an abhorrence of this protective role has been a touchstone of the Reagan Presidency. ''Left to their own devices,'' Mr. Kelman said, ''a lot of people in the Reagan Administration would have urged the virtual elimination of all safety and health regulations. But the level of public commitment to these areas is strong enough to have so far restrained the ideologues.''",THE POLITICS OF SAFETY HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/15/weekinreview/the-politics-of-safety-has-a-life-of-its-own.html

Since 1975, when Congress made the temporary limit permanent, each successive legislative session has seen a flurry of bills aimed at repealing it.

''It was politically impossible for them to change it,'' said Joan Claybrook, who headed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration during the Carter years and is now president of Public Citizen, a consumer group.",THE POLITICS OF SAFETY HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/15/weekinreview/the-politics-of-safety-has-a-life-of-its-own.html

C. Boyden Gray, who was counsel for Vice President Bush's Regulatory Relief Task Force, insists the air bag decision, for instance, is an aberration. ''It isn't a classic example of purely private behavior that has no external consequences,'' he said. ''The whole question of highway accidents does put a very heavy burden on medical bills, which all taxpayers have to pay.''",THE POLITICS OF SAFETY HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/15/weekinreview/the-politics-of-safety-has-a-life-of-its-own.html
3213,1984-07-15,nyt://article/7abe67f2-a122-5291-a8f9-c8af388d7661,7.0,"Nonetheless, such decisions have dismayed many conservatives and libertarians who supported Mr. Reagan's efforts to remove government from people's lives. ''I don't think it's any of the government's business to protect people from themselves, whether it's seat belts, cyclamates or marijuana,'' said David Boaz, vice president of the Cato Institute, which describes itself as a Washington-based libertarian research organization. ''It seems to me that for all the rhetoric about getting government off our backs, this has been a very paternalistic Administration.'' In yet another instance of the Administration sallying forth on safety issues, there are indications that the White House is reviewing an Environmental Protection Agency recommendation that would significantly lessen, or perhaps eliminate, the amount of lead refiners may add to gasoline. Such a policy would be a startling reversal of the E.P.A's intention during the early days of the Administration, which was to relax or abolish limits on leaded gas. Although many medical authorities have contended for years that leaded gas is a major source of lead poisoning in children, by most accounts the Administration chose to view the problem in terms of its burden on industry. Vice President Bush's task force on regulatory reform singled out the lead limit rule as a prime candidate for revision. In 1983, Anne Gorsuch Burford, then E.P.A. chief, publicly proposed relaxing the regulation. She was reported to have privately told a small gas refinery it could add more than the legal amount of lead because she intended to abolish the limit anyway. The ensuing protests from medical authorities appear to have changed the Administration's mind. ''We are definitely looking at more restrictions on the lead content in gasoline,'' James W. Caldwell, chief of the E.P.A.'s field operations and support division, said in an interview last week. ''The health evidence has demonstrated that there's a need for even stricter regulations.''",THE POLITICS OF SAFETY HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/15/weekinreview/the-politics-of-safety-has-a-life-of-its-own.html

Judge Rothwax balked, believing Mr. Healey should suffer more than just inconvenience or economic hardship. The judge's instincts were sound. This was no barroom fight where the moral issues are as murky as the evidence. The accident snuffed out the lives of three innocent people. Keeping Mr. Healey off New York streets may be important, but so is the need for a public accounting. Of 25,987 felony indictments obtained in New York last year, more than 90 percent were decided by plea bargains. Without this bargaining, in fact, the courts couldn't function. Yet the bargaining is conducted in private, and as long as the parties to a deal are satisfied, nobody objects. It's a rare judge who will speak out for the public interest in justice. How many bargains are as questionable as that in the Healey case? Should judges be more willing to second-guess prosecutors' strategies? Should the prosecutor share sentencing authority so intimately with the judge? And shouldn't there be much more public scrutiny of a process that disposes of nearly all cases?

Tokyo was only 1,500 miles to the north - within range of the new B-29 planes that Boeing was turning out in large numbers. Saipan proved to be tough, as Admiral Spruance had predicted. Cleverly concealed machine guns, mortars and small arms took a heavy toll of the marines in the water and after they had hit the beach. But they charged forward, securing two beachheads from which they would not be dislodged. By the end of the second day, they had suffered 4,000 casualties, and Lieut. Gen. Holland Smith of the Marines called for the reserves, the Army's 27th Infantry Division.

In a short story you can appreciate their frustrations, but it might be difficult to live with them for a whole novel. You can get through a story before you get uncomfortable. Small things - the attention to detail - can keep you going.'' A similar point was made by Mark Helprin, for whom the shorter form offers a a chance to explore more subtle textures. ''You can be calm in a short story. You can be calm and tranquil for 20 pages and say what you want to say and keep your hold on the reader. If you try to write a novel that is placid for 700 pages, no one will finish it.'' Hortense Calisher also points to ''the refreshment in changing forms.''

Along with this, there has to be a belief in the essential correctness of that world. A belief that the known world has reasons for existing, and is worth writing about, and is not likely to go up in smoke in the process.

And Cheever's collection in '78 - suddenly there was a collection of short stories on the best-seller lists, and there was Cheever in the pages of Newsweek, opining on what made a good short story. I think it's a good time for short story writers.'' It remains a hard fact of literary life that, good times or no, short story writers seldom see more than small change for their efforts. And most publishing houses would still rather take a chance on a novel. ''I think publishers expect you to write a novel,'' says Bobbie Ann Mason.

After writing, with Carl Bernstein, about the dark side of American politics in ''All the President's Men'' and ''The Final Days,'' it may have seemed a natural step for Bob Woodward to do ''Wired,'' a book about the dark side of American show business. There's plenty of show business in politics and plenty of politics in show business. And John Belushi has been popularly represented as a sacrificial victim of show business politics and pressures.",CLOSE-UP OF JOHN BELUSHI,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/02/books/books-of-the-times-close-up-of-john-belushi.html

But he says he never met his subject and his book makes no explicit judgment about his Mr. Belushi's career or his behavior.

Through witnesses' accounts, Mr. Woodward reconstitutes an endless series of endless nights with his subject, but so much of this is done with a deadpan objectivity that it becomes repetitious and monotonous. We tire of reading about the cocaine shots, the Quaaludes, the arguments with producers and directors. One of the major issues in the book is Mr. Belushi's screenplay, ''Noble Rot.''

He may have been the most frequently warned addict of his time. While his insatiable hunger for stimulus may have led him to drugs, it might just as easily have led him to work, or love, or friendship. And though his death, to many, made him a martyr, it may be that we use that word too easily these days. John's younger brother, Jimmy, said that he was victimized by success. Maybe he is right, in a sense.

''Have you taken leave of your senses?'' ''Stick around, old-timer,'' Archibald said. ''Tonight you may be inspired to revise your lines.''

(He was also nominated for his 1966 production of ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and he won an Oscar for his direction of ''The Graduate'' in 1967). ''Silkwood'' was followed a month later by the hit Broadway production of ''The Real Thing,'' To watch Nichols at work is to perceive something about the making of a play that will never be discerned by its audience. To hear him talk about his work, as he did recently in full candor, is to perceive a good deal about the making of a director and the sources of his creativity - in Nichols's case, a blend of life experiences that he applies to every project, whether a genial comedy, like ''The Odd Couple,'' or a tragicomedy, like ''Hurlyburly.''",MIKE NICHOLS: THE SPECIAL RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE DIRECTOR'S ART,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/magazine/mike-nichols-the-special-risks-and-rewards-of-the-director-s-art.html

Euphorics sale, purchase and use are consensual acts, like liquor sales, and thus go unreported by their ''victims,'' which is what makes them so different from the kinds of criminal violations against which laws can be readily enforced, such as murder, assault, rape, arson and larceny. The criminal sanction is a meaningful response only when it is applied to conduct that a consensus of all strata of society condemns as malevolent, not just foolish, unhealthy or vaguely antisocial. An earlier generation learned this lesson the hard way during Prohibition, but we, their stubborn offspring, have relentlessly ignored it. With millions of our citizens at ease in their routine use of illegal euphorics, it is perfectly obvious that the across-the-board consensus indispensable to enforceable criminal laws is utterly lacking. A citizen who witnesses a robbery will instinctively rush to the aid of the fallen victim, will call an ambulance or police and may even pursue the culprit - all without the prompting or sponsorship of high-minded commissions. The same good citizen, however, will ignore an open street sale of cocaine, which is why a drug-tip program similar to the one Mr. Schanberg celebrates was abandoned in Baltimore soon after it was begun.","DON'T JAIL THE 'EUPHORICS' PEDDLERS, TAX THEM",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/opinion/l-don-t-jail-the-euphorics-peddlers-tax-them-182745.html

The complainant was brought before the cameras in the office of Mario Merola, the Bronx District Attorney, and she demanded nothing less than the death penalty. A pious time was had by many. By the time the woman reached court, however, she admitted that her encounter with Mr. Craig had been in some measure amiable. They met at a welfare office and strolled out together to share a marijuana cigarette. She gave him her name and address. There was never any knife. Why had she held to a fabricated story until just before the trial? There's no simple answer. But surely the fact that prominent officials had used the case as a club against Judge Lasker made it that much harder for her to come out with the truth. Mr. Craig is no saint. His record of arrests and minor convictions stretches back to 1969. But he did not deserve to be portrayed as a vicious predator.

The problem is the way he has chosen to tell it in his autobiography, which is part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation series of scientists' memoirs. Mr. Luria has boxed off parts of his adventurous life into chapters that stick strictly to their assigned topics: his early years in Italy, where he was born in 1912; his emigration to America in 1940, a refugee from Fascism; his exemplary career as a scientist, teacher and administrator (he organized and remains director of M.I.T.'s Cancer Research Center); how his affinity for the arts, especially painting and poetry, took hold; his vivid political involvements and, finally, a closing chapter on what he calls ''Emotions.'' He scatters some fascinating clues to his abundant talent and complex personality throughout the first nine chapters, withholding the connective schema until the last.

His mother, in particular, had an acute sense of physical fragility, which she managed to impart to her elder son, Giuseppe. The young Salvador rebelled quite successfully against the family fearfulness, although physical courage and athletic prowess always eluded him. But in the last chapter we learn that after a severe illness Mr. Luria's mother became addicted to opiates. Even though these drugs could be legally obtained by prescription in Italy, her affliction remained a source of shame and secretiveness in the Luria family.",NOBEL WINNER SOLVES LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/books/nobel-winner-solves-life.html

In the years since his arrival in the United States, the scientist seems to have compensated for his lack of physical courage with support of socialist politics, even during the McCarthy period. Isolated throughout the book, so that their impact is almost lost, are items of the price he has paid - in 1951, he was refused an American passport, so that he could not attend important conferences overseas; in 1957, after he and nine other scientists signed Linus Pauling's protest against atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, he and his wife were visited by an Immigration officer for the apparent purpose of intimidation; in 1969, when he won the Nobel Prize for medicine, he learned that he had been officially blacklisted by the National Institutes of Health from serving on review panels.",NOBEL WINNER SOLVES LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/books/nobel-winner-solves-life.html

But his building-block narrative also parallels his approach to science. He likes the definition given by Sir Peter Medawar, his fellow biologist, of science as ''the art of the soluble.'' Mr. Luria's preferred way of working is to concentrate on tracing ''patient pathways of simple soluble steps.'' At the heart of his narrative are the two moments when he saw suddenly and clearly the resolutions he had been approaching step by step, when ''one's thinking seems suddenly to mesh precisely with the phenomenon under study.''",NOBEL WINNER SOLVES LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/books/nobel-winner-solves-life.html

His flight to America - he left Paris in the nick of time, just ahead of the Nazis - was star-studded with other, more famous refugees and guardian angels who provided jobs and invaluable contacts. In 1943, safe at Indiana University, he was struggling to disprove the traditional wisdom that bacteria had no chromosomes or genes, and therefore could not undergo genetic mutation. Mr. Luria happened to attend a faculty dance, where he idly watched a colleague feed dimes into a slot machine until he hit the jackpot. ''It dawned on me that slot machines and bacterial mutations have something to teach each other.'' Back in the lab, Mr. Luria finally was able to design an experiment that demonstrated genetic change in bacteria. Later, in 1952, a broken test tube forced him to borrow some bacteria that serendipitously took him another step forward: he discovered the restriction-modification phenomenon in bacterial DNA, which eventually had important implications for cancer research.",NOBEL WINNER SOLVES LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/books/nobel-winner-solves-life.html

Social satire, political satire, every sort of satire seemed to be modestly thriving, and at a time when the world was rather happier than now and seemed less in need of that savage indignation which the poet Juvenal recommended to would-be members of the International Brotherhood of Parodists, Lampooners and Scurrilous Vituperators. The knives have occasionally been drawn since then - in 1973 by the National Lampoon, for instance, with its wickedly conceived Woodshuck Festival of Love, Peace and Death - but mostly they have been left to rust in their sheaths or handed over to television, which has proceeded to substitute bromide for venom at the end of the blade. So the coincidental convergence on New York of no less than three revues in recent days - ''Babalooney,'' ''Orwell That Ends Well,'' ''A . . . My Name Is Alice'' - raised nostalgic and more than nostalgic hopes.

''Babalooney'' needn't delay us more than a moment, because it wasn't delayed itself more than a moment in New York. It came from Chicago's Practical Theater to the Provincetown Playhouse, artlessly confident of wowing the big city with funny faces, gratuitous acrobatics, parodies of TV quizzes (''Can you spot the real Tarzan?'') and a slim, sub-Pythonesque sketch about a fast-food joint that serves ''Big Macbeths'' and extract of ''Music Man.'' Just once the company attempted something mordant, a burlesque of Kennedy-worship, with a cross-section of grieving Americans reverentially remembering where they were at the time of the death of a ''symbol for a generation'' who actually turned out to be television's Sebastian Cabot. But that seemed at least 15 years too late for maximum impact. At any rate, New York remained unwowed, and the Practical Theater people slunk prematurely back to their icebox in the Midwest.","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

It's a little confusing to learn that this is presented by ''The Original Chicago Second City Company,'' since that would mean some of the bright, shiny faces on stage played the early revues from the crib or even the womb. Nevertheless, there are times when one hears echoes of Mike Nichols and Elaine May in their more agonizingly modern and convolutedly contemporary moods: ''How long have you been sleeping together?,'' ''About six months,'' ''That's almost a relationship .'' The opening number, a muddled, maudlin get-together (''Oh, that war was a good time!'') of a cross-section of veterans of the fun-decade, should be seen by anyone tempted to take ''The Big Chill'' and its ilk too seriously. But in general the company seems more interested in the quick laugh than the slow, wry smile of recognition or self-recognition. A sketch in which a waitress flings herself in high, cinematic passion at her more winsome customers is typical: it's amusing, at moments very amusing, but pretty guileless in its choice of targets and predictable once you've cracked its comic code.","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

And I, for one, laughed at the face on the photographer's tripod which gives a very literal meaning to the phrase ''the camera loves you,'' at the grade-school teachers who supplement their paltry incomes by robbing their one-time pupils, and, most of all, at the ineffably sleazy talk-show tyrant who, with a sniggering sidekick, brings Mother Teresa into the studio for a sexual grilling: ''Let me ask you the question that I'm sure is on everyone's lips - how often do you do it?''","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

But it does suddenly give the show the kick that, for all its merits, it mostly lacks. To bring on Margaret Thatcher, and then ask her to do nothing except puff marijuana and bop to rock music, is schoolboy cheek and chutzpah, not satire. The revue isn't, it's true, totally unconscious of politics. Someone briefly wonders if a robotic alien wasn't substituted for John Glenn during space reentry all those years ago. There is a clever if hurried song, delivered by pseudo- Hispanics to clinks and clangs on instruments that include bedpans and a carrot-grater, which actually manages to mention nuclear proliferation, among other international woes. But only once is political comment more than passing gesture; and that is in a Gilbert and Sullivan parody in which warring Chicago potentates are reconciled by the ghost of Mayor Daley, opining from the hereafter that unity will allow them to cheat the local citizenry more efficiently. And New Yorkers, one fears, will find that a bit insular.","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

But neither is its feminism the grim, baleful sort, nor does it seek to relax you by lulling your mind with theatrical Valium. This is a sane, witty show, with time neither for macho swinishness nor broomstick paranoia. A raucous hardhat who hoots and whistles at a passing woman's breasts is much discountenanced by an equal but opposite assault on his own private parts. On the other hand, the revue is even tougher and funnier at the expense of its own extremer allies. From time to time, Roo Brown comes lugubriously forward clutching a book of poems ''For Women Only,'' which turn out to be all leaden accusation and plodding self-pity: ''I am a woman, a crippled bird - flap, flap, flap, flap.''","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

Only if you believe women should retreat from heterosexuality in high ideological dudgeon, rather than make the traditional relationships work a bit better, will you conclude that. The cumulative picture that emerges from the deft lyrics and occasional snatch of dialogue isn't an especially happy one. It is of women trapped in offices or closeted in studio apartments, dreaming of rich wooers magicking them out of their ruts, deserted by lovers or husbands who decide they ''need'' younger flesh, criticized for their handling of their children, yet somehow managing to muddle on, thanks to friends and hope and humor. Men, the show slyly suggests, have a terrible tendency to transform themselves into creeps. Women, it concedes, lack self-sufficiency: ''Statue of Liberty, sister of stone, help me to live alone.''

''Forbidden Broadway 84'' could at times be mistaken for a sort of incestuous love-in, with two actors and two actresses affectionately burlesqueing their more celebrated brothers and sisters; but not often, and usually not at all. On wiggles Jan Neuberger's Carol Channing, all big red lips, 10-foot tongue and goggling fatuity. In strut and click clockwork figures, ''plastic stars who never eat,'' giving their mechanical all to ''David Merrick Street.''

The ''concept,'' words and direction are in any case by Gerard Alessandrini.

If we follow this line of thinking too far, we will, admittedly, end up arguing that only disaffected White House secretaries can successfully burlesque the President, or those criticized in ''Mayor'' lampoon Ed Koch. But theatrical writers and performers are at least citizens and voters. Some of them surely feel at odds with establishments, institutions and systems other than those immediately touching their employment or unemployment. There must be just a few who could bring the same comic passion to the wider world that ''Forbidden Broadway'' proves can be brought to a small one; but, if so, they are silent, and their silence is a pity. To leave politician X to the newspaper cartoonists, or statesman Y to a genially derivative entertainment like television's ''Not Necessarily the News'' seems a sad, sad waste: akin to a professional hunter finding some much-coveted big game in his sights, imploring to be peppered, and then handing over the kill to a distant cousin he hardly even knows.","SATIRE IS BACK, BUT WITHOUT THE BITE",https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/stage-view-satire-is-back-but-without-the-bite.html

Within moments of the opening, it was clear precisely where the story would go and how it would end. The callow young hoofer would of course become an overnight Broadway sensation, and many of the usual setbacks and alarms would hit her en route to that unlikely goal. But the show is unobjectionable, indeed enchanting because all along one knows one is watching a fantasy, a fairy-tale, a ''Cinderella'' of the theater. ''The Rink's'' pretensions are much greater.

She said: ''People who don't live here, including the police, say, 'If you can't take it, move out.' They don't seem to understand most of us can't afford to move anywhere else. We are old or students or just struggling to pay off debts and live simply. Besides, this is our home.'' The Lower East Side is a neighborhood of the poor, and one of the reasons the drug problem has no national urgency is that the middle class finds it psychically convenient to think of drugs as a disease of the slums, a disease of those without money or jobs who are turning instead to dreams to be gotten from a needle or a pill. But that notion itself is a dream. Drugs are everywhere because the middle class and the affluent accept them now as part of the culture. Cocaine, a drug that can destroy brain chemistry, is now in wide use among the middle class. A poll by the National Institute on Drug Abuse last year showed that 22 million Americans admitted to having tried cocaine, with five million of these regular users and one million addicted - the same number as heroin junkies. Another study estimated that overall drug abuse results in a $26 billion annual cost to the national economy in crime, medical expenses and lost productivity. And the people of the slums alone did not run up that bill. President Reagan apparently doesn't think it's much of a problem. He gave it to his wife as one of her projects, like highway beautification. She goes around putting out anti-drug comic books and talking about the problem on television, while her husband cuts Federal aid for local drug rehabilitation programs. We need Mrs. Reagan's education program and we need treatment and rehabilitation programs and we need more and better law enforcement and we need Federal crackdowns on the supply sources overseas and the entry points here. We need, in short, everything we can think of - including a willingness to at least try controversial experiments, such as legal maintenance programs for addicts to keep them productive at their jobs and away from crime. Drugs are a problem for every neighborhood and income group because we have become a feel-young culture where people talk about being ''recreational'' users of dangerous drugs as though they were going bowling or skiing. That's an adult example not likely to inspire abstinence in children. If we don't care, then we should say so - and stop the pretense of concern. That way, we'll be relaxed and recreational when the next investigation of drug trafficking outside schools shows that the 35-out-of-36 score has become a perfect 36-out-of-36.",NEW YORK ; SCHOOLYARD RECREATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/opinion/new-york-schoolyard-recreation.html

With drug abuse escalating among athletes, league and team officials are increasingly determined to protect their integrity and investment. Simultaneously, the athletes are becoming increasingly fearful that they are under surveillance in ways that could compromise their privacy or civil rights. ''It is an interesting tension,'' said Roy Eisenhardt, the president of the Oakland A's. ''It is the players' right of privacy versus the leagues' right to protect an institution.'' The issue is fraught with emotion and sometimes clouded by public relations considerations. League and team officials are genuinely concerned but also anxious to create the image of vigilance at a time when the public is increasingly critical of the athletes' behavior. The players, too, are balancing substantive issues and matters of perception. Those among them who are not involved with drugs do not condone criminal activity and are eager to see the situation controlled and their own reputations preserved. But they object to some of the tactics used by their employers and resent a climate of opinion where it is assumed that they must have something to hide if they defend their right to privacy.",KEEPING WATCH ON ATHLETES: AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/12/sports/keeping-watch-on-athletes-an-emotional-issue.html

More influence on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will be sought by Governor Kean to help advance New Jersey's economic recovery, according to his State of the State Message. Mr. Kean said that he and Governor Cuomo had recently agreed that the bistate agency should undertake a wide range of projects including development of the Hoboken waterfront, an upgrading of the PATH railroad line, construction of a new office building in Newark and increases in the agency's lease payments for Newark International Airport. (A1:5-6.) The response time of ambulances operated by New York City - once the slowest of any major American city - has been reduced to under 10 minutes for high-priority 911 emergency calls, according to officials. They said the reduction gave the city one of the swiftest ambulance response times in the country. (B1:1-6.) A man confessed voluntarily to having been the gunman who went on a 15-minute two-block rampage in midtown Manhattan in October 1981 and randomly killed a 17-year-old youth, according to the police. They said the 24-year-old suspect had told the police he was making the confession because he had ''a guilty conscience'' and was ''high on marijuana'' when he went berserk. (A1:3-5.) A percentage of experienced guards should be required in all maximum security prisons in New York State, according to two key legislators. They also called for legislation to replace the present grievance procedure for inmates with one that is ''swift and credible.'' (B2:1-2.) A major landfill has been closed by New York State environmental officials. They said they had closed the Town of Ramapo's landfill because they were fearful that drinking water might be contaminated. (B2:1.)

In the larger-than-life ''Kabuki Dancer'' of 1954, he explores what was to become a masterly talent for combining rusted metal oddments - in this case, a grille, a pot, a spoke wheel for a head and, for feet, two metal shoe plates connected by a steplike arrangement of metal strips - in a far wittier whole than the sum of its improbable parts.",ART: A JOYOUS MEMORIAL TO RICHARD STANKIEWICZ,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/06/arts/art-a-joyous-memorial-to-richard-stankiewicz.html

In the early 1960's, he made a series of double-faced heads, in one of which - on view here - links from a heavy chain are used to form a march of curly hair both uniting and separating the two ''faces,'' as well as to create a beard for one. In a couple of totally abstract pieces from the same period, he plays off flat and curved planes against volumetric cylinders, closely evoking the two-dimensional machine abstractions of Leger. In a humorous, totally abstract work of 1975, he poises a piece of a cylinder on the edge of a cube. Most formally oriented sculptors would have let it go at that, but Stankiewicz treats the opening that occurs between the two as a hungry maw, shoving into it a bundle of cylindrical sticks. Actually, in 1965, Stankiewicz had his last show of the ''junk'' sculpture that has influenced artists as discrete as Anthony Caro and Jean Tinguely. He left the New York art world to settle in Massachusetts, then went to Australia to work for a while. The availability of mill materials - I-beams, angle irons, steel tubing and so forth - at a factory there brought a much more formal geometry to his sculpture (although it kept its coatings of rust). And when he returned to the exhibition scene in the early 70's, the work had a new look. Where it had been witty and intense, it was now of a classic serenity, composed of big, sawed-off cylindrical forms arranged in a fine balance. An example is ''Untitled'' of 1975, a human-scale piece finshed in reddish rust, in which tilted drum shapes are joined to a leaning cylinder with magnificent craftsmanship.",ART: A JOYOUS MEMORIAL TO RICHARD STANKIEWICZ,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/06/arts/art-a-joyous-memorial-to-richard-stankiewicz.html
