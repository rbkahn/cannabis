In the past, Mr. Reagan has said that the marines were providing only a symbolic presence. (A1:3-4.) Gen. Paul X. Kelley was defended by President Reagan. At a news conference, Mr. Reagan said he did not think General Kelley, the Marine Corps Commandant, ''was attempting to cover up for anyone'' when he testified before Congress about the destruction of the Marine headquarters in Beirut by a terrorist truck bomb on Oct. 23. A report by a House subcommittee said the testimony given by General Kelley and other officials was ''often inaccurate, erroneous and misleading.'' (A1:2.)

(The paradox in American letters is that it has always been easier for a woman to write and for a man to be published.) Growing up, I had thought of sports as wasteful and humiliating, and the idea of manliness as a bore. My wanting to become a writer was not a flight from that oppressive role playing, but I quickly saw that it was at odds with it. Everything in stereotyped manliness goes against the life of the mind. The Hemingway personality is too tedious to go into here, but certainly it was not until this aberrant behavior was examined by feminists in the 1960's that any male writer dared question the pugnacity in Hemingway's fiction.

Fiction writing is equated with a kind of dispirited failure and is only manly when it produces wealth. Money is masculinity. So is drinking. Being a drunkard is another assertion, if misplaced, of manliness. The American male writer is traditionally proud of his heavy drinking. But we are also very literal-minded people. A man proves his manhood in America in old-fashioned ways. He kills lions, like Hemingway; or he hunts ducks, like Nathanael West; or he makes pronouncements, like ''A man should carry enough knife to defend himself with,'' as James Jones once said to a Life magazine interviewer.

He was arrested four days before a Congressional hearing into allegations of racially motivated police brutality and his death has become a rallying point for critics of the police. The difficulty of determining conclusively what happened to Mr. Stewart illustrates how elusive the truth can be when the police are accused of using excessive force. Often there are no independent witnesses. When there are, the testimony sometimes is contradictory. Even presumably factual evidence, like an autopsy, can fail to resolve crucial questions which, in Mr. Stewart's case, are many. Was he beaten by the transit police? Did he fall accidentally? Was he injured when he struggled with officers using justifiable force to subdue him? As a grand jury continued its investigation, Mr. Stewart's parents last week accused the Manhattan District Attorney and the city's Chief Medical Examiner of a cover-up and asked Governor Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor. The medical examiner said he had acted properly; the prosecutor said all leads were being pursued. Defenders of the police force, such as Philip Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, say that concentrating on isolated cases leaves a mistaken impression that brutality is pervasive. The number of formal brutality complaints does, in fact, represent a small fraction of all contacts between the public and the police. In 1982, 5,255 complaints of misconduct were filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, up 38 percent from 1981. Complaints of force resulting in injury dropped to 869 last year from 1,296 the previous year. Thirty-one percent of all complaints last year were brought by blacks and 13 percent by Hispanic people. Others say that only by examining individual cases do the difficulties of the debate come into focus. Are members of the police force more likely to withhold the benefit of the doubt from a suspect who is black or Hispanic? Do some suspects exaggerate the force used by officers to rationalize their own violent behavior? Mr. Stewart, a black man, was arrested in a 14th Street subway station as he was on his way home to Brooklyn from a Manhattan dance club. A lanky 140- pound artist and model, Mr. Stewart was a ''retiring and almost docile'' man who ''had a history of avoiding confrontation,'' said Louis Clayton Jones, a family lawyer. Mr. Stewart was arrested, the police said, because he had scrawled letters on the subway station wall. He was also charged with possession of a marijuana cigarette stub. Lawyers for Mr. Stewart's parents said he had consumed six beers before the incident and that when he was admitted to Bellevue the level of alcohol in his blood was more than double the legal standard for drunken driving. According to the police report, after Mr. Stewart was handcuffed he attempted to flee to the street, where the arresting officer restrained him. While being driven to district transit headquarters in Union Square, he began kicking officers, the report said. Once there, he ''again became violent and necessary force was used to restrain'' him, according to the report. As he was being driven to Bellevue for psychiatric observation, the police said, Mr. Stewart went into a coma.",DETERMINING HOW MUCH FORCE IS TOO MUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/weekinreview/determining-how-much-force-is-too-much.html

Woods on the head, breaking his eyeglasses, in an incident Mr. Woods said occurred last June outside his Harlem restaurant. Mr. Woods said he drove there after learning of a fire. Officers said his double-parked car blocked a patrol car and he was charged with disorderly conduct and traffic violations. The Review Board found no evidence of brutality and the Justice Department is reviewing the case.) The city's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Elliot Gross, said in a preliminary report that Mr. Stewart died of cardiac arrest. He amended that conclusion on Nov. 2, saying the cause of death was an injury to the spinal cord in the upper neck. Dr. Gross declined to say what he thought caused the injury until he testified before the grand jury. Even if the panel concludes that the force used to subdue Mr. Stewart was excessive, it must still decide which of the officers was responsible. In any event, the family's expected suit against the city for wrongful death will be judged by other standards. Of the 98 allegations of brutality raised at the Congressional hearing, claims ranging from $16,500 to $50,000 were paid by the city in four cases since 1978, even though the officers involved had been absolved of wrongdoing by local prosecutors or grand juries and, in two of the cases, by the Justice Department. The Police Department presented its own study last month of the 98 allegations of brutality. Of the 61 incidents that took place while Mayor Koch was in office, nine did not involve civilians and officers of different races. Of the remaining 52 cases, 25 resulted in a civilian's death. Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire said that 21 of those 25 cases involved the threat or use of a weapon against an officer. Eleven of the 25 were investigated by the Justice Department, which found no wrongdoing. Two cases are pending. The grand jury trying to determine why Michael Stewart died is not expected to complete its work for at least a month.

The publishers have thought highly enough of the book to award it their Maxwell Perkins Prize for best first novel of the year.

When construction began at Nine Mile 2 in 1974, it was supposed to cost $381 million and be in service before the end of the decade. The estimate now is $4.2 billion, with completion in 1986. ''I am consumed with the certain knowledge that we're doing it again,'' said Rosemary S. Pooler, a member of the Public Service Commission, who calls Nine Mile 2 ''Shoreham West.'' Mrs. Pooler complained recently of living ''on a planet of amnesiacs.''",THE REACTOR THAT MAY BREAK THE BANK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/weekinreview/the-reactor-that-may-break-the-bank.html
462307,1983-10-30,nyt://article/f4c6dbed-9189-5fc1-8226-9420579adcae,4.0,"Reports submitted in recent weeks to the P.S.C. indicate that the setbacks at Nine Mile 2 may not be over. As at Shoreham, the price estimate has been rising for the last decade at about 25 percent a year. Construction was slowed by design changes ordered by Federal officials, and the delays added to interest charges. In addition, inflation drove up the cost of labor and materials and interest rates have been higher than anticipated. But Shoreham is almost completed, and Nine Mile 2 has at least three years to go. As completion approaches, cost increases come faster. More than $1 billion of the cost of each reactor is simply interest on money borrowed during construction. As more gets invested and as interest rates remain high, total costs escalate faster. Even if completed according to current schedule, Nine Mile 2 is likely to be more costly than Shoreham per kilowatt of capacity. (The total cost of Nine Mile 2 will be higher, but it will also generate more power than Shoreham.) A timely completion of Nine Mile 2 isn't assured. The P.S.C. recently got a letter from Jennifer McGrath, one of three ''construction monitors'' it had placed at the plant to keep an eye on rising costs. She said she could smell marijuana in the reactor building and had watched workers get drunk in the parking lot before the afternoon shift. She contended that workers were trying to stretch out Nine Mile 2 because no other huge construction projects were on the horizon. A consultant also told the P.S.C. recently that a $500 million cost overrun announced this year would not cover the final cost of the plant and he hinted that schedules would not be met. The commission, however, is not about to re- examine its decision last year to allow completion of the reactor, now described as three-quarters finished. ''We don't have the competence or capability of doing it (a re-examination) in any kind of reasonable time frame,'' said Gerald F. Walsh, chief of the P.S.C. staff's electric utility division. Why? Because so much of the staff is now consumed with Shoreham, Mr. Walsh said. The commission is investigating whether the Long Island Lighting Company's investment in Shoreham was ''prudent.'' At Nine Mile 2, however, the question being raised is whether it is prudent to continue construction. Mrs. Pooler, at least, thinks the question deserves intensive new study. In an unrelated 1980 decision, the P.S.C. said it would consider ''the prudence of a company's continuing decisions to proceed with the construction of major plant additions, not merely the prudence of the initial decision to build.'' (Utilities do not get reimbursed for costs judged imprudent.) There is a catch, however. Even if it were agreed now that Nine Mile 2 should have been dropped when the projected cost overruns reached 500 percent or 1,000 percent, the decisions to finish could still be deemed reasonable given existing knowledge when they were made.",THE REACTOR THAT MAY BREAK THE BANK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/weekinreview/the-reactor-that-may-break-the-bank.html

At the present estimate, power from Nine Mile 2 will cost Niagara Mohawk 12.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, about double the cost of electricity from an upstate coal plant. Lilco's cost will be more than 12.6 cents because its financing costs are higher, and because its power must be transmitted to Long Island. Even at 12.6 cents, the cost of power from Nine Mile 2 would be 50 percent more than what it now costs Lilco to generate power using imported oil.",THE REACTOR THAT MAY BREAK THE BANK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/weekinreview/the-reactor-that-may-break-the-bank.html

But the size of the possible savings is uncertain, because the price of oil has behaved unpredictably. For example, the analysis of Nine Mile 2 that resulted in the P.S.C.'s decision last year to continue construction was based on a prediction that oil prices would rise by 10.5 percent a year until 1985. Instead, prices have fallen, opening a gap between prediction and reality that is now 30 percent.",THE REACTOR THAT MAY BREAK THE BANK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/weekinreview/the-reactor-that-may-break-the-bank.html

Groups of immigrant workers succeed one another; company and private housing, churches and schools go up; railroads are built and decay; there are accidents in the mill, disputes over pay, new labor laws. The diaries and letters of mill owners and members of their families tell us of the passing generations and the changes in work, society and the nation. Mr. Macaulay does not make life always pleasant or work always equitable or decent: Children work; women are always subordinates; the early mills use cotton supplied from slave plantations. But the great milling machines he creates are wonderful giants that, because we have seen them made by men's hands, are companionable. How well the machines will be understood by young readers it is hard to say. An older generation that grew up dismantling clocks for fun (the kind with gears, not just quartz crystals) or played with erector sets and watched their fathers working on simple old cars might understand Mr. Macaulay's mill machinery more easily than today's youngsters who have a quicker grasp of high technology than of simple mechanics.

She rightly contends that the spectacular volcanic destruction of Thera in about 1500 B.C. is important principally because of the devastation it wrought upon Crete and her Minoan colonies (ash from the eruption has been found at distances up to 400 miles from the island), and not because it may have given rise to a legend recorded over a thousand years later by Plato.

Back in the early 1970's the Nixon Administration demonstrated that putting drugs high up on the foreign policy agenda could have some effect. Administration officials urged Turkey and France to develop far-reaching programs to combat the flow of heroin, and for a while at least, the amount available in U.S. cities declined. High-level diplomacy also was instrumental in encouraging Mexico to curtail the growth of opium poppy. The new measure might force more effective anti-drug action by Pakistan, which, with Afghanistan, is said to provide more than 85 percent of the heroin sold in New York City. Pakistani leaders claim they have little control over the northwest Khyber region, where most of the drugs intended for export are produced. But Senator Moynihan, who visited Pakistan in the spring and toured the areas where the opium poppy flourishes, argues that Pakistan's rulers control what they want to control. A stern message from Congress on foreign aid might well give them greater reason to wipe out heroin production within their borders. The amendment would at least force the White House and Congress to subject Pakistan's efforts to greater scrutiny - and reinforce the point that winning the drug war is all but impossible so long as it remains a local battle.",No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/19/opinion/no-headline-175274.html

It was a generation that prided itself on its loss of political innocence - the legacy of Vietnam and the assassinations - and yet it was a generation that in many ways remained peculiarly naive. The attention paid to the anti-Vietnam protests; the startling social changes wrought by the ''sexual revolution'' - these events only helped confirm many students' belief that change was easy to effect.

In the U.S. alone, it is used on over 10.7 million acres annually: it is regularly applied to orchards, soybeans, sugar cane, potatoes and numerous other crops, as well as along public roadways and around railroads, to kill weeds. The marijuana eradication program adheres to environmental standards and regulations. The illegal cannabis cultivators, however, are threatening the environment by using excessive amounts of insecticides and fungicides in national parklands. Further, they use violence to block public access to their marijuana ''gardens'' on public land. Increasingly, forest service and law enforcement officers are finding themselves the targets of this violence. You focus on the serious health effects associated with ingesting paraquat-contaminated marijuana and imply that because of the deleterious health implications the U.S. stopped its paraquat subsidy to Mexico. Absent from your argument, however, is reference to the Congressional repeal of this foreign assistance prohibition in December 1981 and, more importantly, to continued Mexican use of paraquat in its cannabis eradication effort since 1976. Since the ''paraquat scare'' of 1977-78, when ''contaminated'' Mexican marijuana was first marketed in the U.S., not one case of human poisoning from paraquat-contaminated marijuana has been confirmed in this country. A far more important public policy issue is the health hazard of smoking marijuana. Marijuana is a dangerous drug which has damaging effects on the lungs, reproductive organs and the immunity system; it impairs memory, learning performance and motivation; it may permanently damage brain tissue. Eleven percent of our young people are regular marijuana users. About 60,000 of them seek medical treatment each year because of the health problems associated with marijuana abuse.

Urged on by the United States, which had sent two Awac surveillance planes, now withdrawn, to track the Libyan- backed invasion, the French had come to try to contain Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and to do so was to renege on all the anti-interventionist promises made during the party's long years in opposition. But, ultimately, French national interest - its need to maintain its great influence in the region - was threatened. And so, hard-faced men who had seen service in Zaire and the Central African Republic were once again dispatched to mold destinies far from the shores of France. The commitment is open-ended, and the equipment they have brought suggests they are in for a long stay. The prize, as ever in Chad's history, is not so much Ndjamena itself. When the city was first colonized, it was designed as a gateway to the more worthwhile prizes provided by the wealthier French colonies to the south and west.

Investigators found that enough poisoned pot was crossing the border annually to expose scores of pot smokers to a highly toxic dose. The United States stopped its paraquat subsidy to Mexico. Now paraquat is back. The Reagan Administration authorized using it in Georgia's Chattahoochie National Forest this month, only to be blocked temporarily in court. But the Drug Enforcement Administration says spraying will continue in states where pot is grown. The White House minimizes the health risks, noting that Federal agents are careful to prevent harvesting of the crop after spraying. But no one can guarantee that contaminated pot won't reach the marketplace. Why, then, is the Government so willing to risk poisoning people? Since there is no practical way to halt more than a small fraction of commerce in pot directly, the only logic of curtailing the flow with paraquat is to scare buyers out of the market. If illegal traffic in marijuana posed overwhelming risks to society, playing with pot smokers' lives might be justified. But there's hardly a national consensus on the dangers of marijuana. According to Government surveys, about two-thirds of all young adults have tried pot; millions consume it regularly as a recreational drug, like alcohol. Drug enforcement administrators have an obligation to disrupt the traffic where possible.

There have been all manner of malfunctions in military computers, the warning systems that flow into them and the command systems that flow out of them. For example, twice in 1971 American nuclear missile submarines accidentally transmitted a properly coded message indicating they had been sunk by enemy action. In 1980, Senators Barry Goldwater and Gary Hart reported that there had been 78 detections of possible attacks transmitted by the United States's missile-attack warning system during 1979 and 69 more during the first half of 1980 (a 77 percent increase) - all of which were of course false. Two were particularly spectacular major alerts: one triggered by the accidental entry of data simulating a real attack into the North American Air Defense Command computer system and one caused by the failure of a computer chip costing less than $1. It is testimony to carefulness of those who design and operate military systems that there has been no accidental nuclear war. Yet accidents keep recurring, sometimes in new and unpredictable ways. We have all read stories about people discovering that some computer had mistakenly declared them dead, doubled their bank account or sent them a $50,000 telephone bill. Most people have probably had less spectacular runins with errant airline or billing computers personally. In ordinary, mundane business, computer-generated mistakes are irritating, but of limited consequence. When dealing with nuclear weapons, even the least imperfection may produce unprecedented disaster. And computers are not perfect; they cannot be. They are the creations of imperfect human beings. People would, after all, invariably have some part in even the highly mechanized chain of decisions and actions involved in launching nuclear war. They design and build the machines of which any automated system would be made. But does direct human participation insure the indefinite prevention of accidental war? As long as the military must recruit human personnel, the answer is no. People are subject to mental, physical and emotional problems that periodically render even the most solid among us unreliable. The nuclear military is not immune. According to Pentagon data from 1975 through 1977, roughly 5,000 nuclear weapons personnel were removed from this duty each year for reasons of alcoholism, drug abuse and mental illness. In March 1971, three men with top security clearance working at the top secret computer section in which nuclear war plans are maintained were arrested for possession and sale of marijuana and LSD. Furthermore, the boredom, isolation and stress of working in the nuclear military is enough to stretch even healthy people beyond their limits of tolerance. A former missile-silo officer writes, in Air Force Magazine: ''A crew member tries not to think about his ultimate responsibility whch could lead to the killing of millions .... He learns to contrast his personal feelings and the role he's expected to play, unquestioningly and automatically .... He tends to see his personal life and official life as totally separate. The launch officer becomes schizoid.'' As long as people are imperfect, we will run some degree of risk whenever we rely on mechanical systems that do not forgive, or compensate for, our inescapable fallibility. The nuclear arms race is such a system - and odds are that it cannot be continued and controlled indefinitely.There are few arms races in history that have not ended in wars.

Eons ago, Point Reyes was over 300 miles south of here, a part of the Tehachapi Mountains, but it drifted.

Shipped off to a highly proper girls' boarding school in Virginia, she showed her rebellious nature by writing to Earl Browder, head of the American Communist Party, informing him that ''many of the girls were interested in joining,'' thus calling down on the school post office a flood of what the headmistress called ''tawdry'' mail.",CHILDREN'S BOOKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/books/children-s-books-177924.html

In spite of the fact that Freud accepted the need of repression in childhood, these schools hoped to prevent the development of adult neuroses by allowing the child to behave according to the dictates of his own instinctual drives. Teachers were encouraged to give sexual information freely, to place no restrictions on masturbation or sex play and to replace all authoritarian rules with permissive methods emphasizing reasoning and explanation. But the results were disastrous. According to Willi Hoffer, a founder of one such experimental institution in Vienna, the Kinderheim Baumgarten, children in these schools often showed themselves to be ''less curious about the more complicated world of objects'' and generally disinclined to learn. As he described them further in a 1945 paper, ''Psychoanalytic Education'': ''They had no perseverance...They seemed egocentric; group demands affected them little. They were extremely intolerant of the demands of adults; timetables, mealtimes, table manners, routine hygienic measures, even if leniently handled, became sources of conflict.'' None of the changes Freud ascribed to the onset of latency seemed to materialize - no greater docility, no eagerness to learn. Indeed, Hoffer observed that the children showed ''an unexpected degree of irritability, a tendency to obsession, depression and anxiety.''",THE LOSS OF CHILDHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/magazine/the-loss-of-childhood.html

Children are usually angry, not irritable; persistent rather than obsessive; unhappy rather than depressed. Yet it appears that these are just as natural to children when they are unrepressed. In a state of nature, children cannot afford to be childlike, to relax, to romp and play, to explore, to be ''curious about the more complicated world of objects,'' above all to learn. Alertness, caution, as in a jungle, must be the watchwords in the unprotected world where children are given instinctual and emotional freedom.",THE LOSS OF CHILDHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/magazine/the-loss-of-childhood.html

Inevitably, in the course of a marital breakup, as parents' attention turns away from matters of child rearing and toward their own suddenly imperative needs, the familiar structure of family life is suspended. At such times, children are often casually included in adult situations once considered unsuitable for the young -taking on advisory roles, for example, in their newly single parents' sex lives.",THE LOSS OF CHILDHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/magazine/the-loss-of-childhood.html

Moreover, poor academic performance, susceptibility to peer influence and delinquent behavior (all characteristic of drug users), as well as suicide and homicide, have been found to be more pronounced among children from homes with one or both parents missing or frequently absent.'' There may be another, less obvious advantage to preserving sexual latency: It may profoundly influence adult behavior toward children. That is, if cultural influences encourage repression of children's sexuality, the child's consequent appearance and behavior may inspire the adults around him to act in a more protective manner.

And just as young animals have programmed into their behavior patterns certain signs of dependence and submissiveness that they display to older and stronger animals in order to avoid being treated aggressively - laying the ears back, dropping the head, placing the tail between the legs - so children not so long ago were obliged to show submissive and dependent behavior to adults: certain formulas of ''respect,'' such as the use of ''sir'' and ''please'' and ''thank you'' - learned behaviors that also fall into the neotenic category.",THE LOSS OF CHILDHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/magazine/the-loss-of-childhood.html

This, in turn, allows the child to pursue his various activities, his exploration, and play - indeed, his entire education -in safety. There are those who see childhood as a form of deprivation. The literary critic Helen Vendler, for instance, refers in passing to ''the poverty of every child's restricted early life'' when she describes ''the passage from a sequestered childhood to a forcibly socialized adulthood.'' The implication of the word ''poverty'' in conjunction with the idea of a ''sequestered'' childhood is this: Were the child to be offered the full wealth of experience that is available to the adult, he would be enriched by it.

Indeed, the child growing up under more protective, old-fashioned circumstances may seem more ''bratty,'' more ''spoiled,'' more demanding than the hardy, self-sufficient child of absent parents. But while a certain level of sophistication is inevitably achieved when a child is forced to take care of himself much of the time, it is not the same thing as maturity. As the child grows older, true maturity, defined by an ability to share, to sacrifice, to be generous, to love unselfishly, and to nurture and care for children of his own, may prove elusive, and in its place, attention-seeking and narcissism become the characteristics that define his adult life.

If anything, it worked the other way. I need a lot of attention - really a lot more than most of my friends who grew up more slowly.'' It would be foolish to suggest that childhood in the bygone Age of Protection was a continuously happy state. Rare indeed was the child whose childhood was completely free of jealousy or shame or anger or any of the other forms of human misery. In his prize-winning memoir ''Growing Up,'' Russell Baker describes his childhood during the Depression years, darkened by poverty, marital discord, illness and death. And yet he is able to write: ''The occasional outbursts of passion that flickered across my childhood were like summer storms.

It was the secure certainty that he was a child and that adults were adults, and that in spite of the wretchedness he might glimpse in their world he could still remain, in his different state, untouched by it. This is the essence of adult protectiveness: transmitting to children the sense that they are separate and special and under the adults' careful supervision.

The village has tropical beauty, sun-saturated tranquillity and languor. At the same time, it is shabby and oppressively hot, like many quiet, forgotten backwaters of the third world. But Luma is anything but forgotten. It is on the island of Tau, part of the tiny Manua archipelago of the Samoan islands, which includes the larger, independent country of Western Samoa and the unincorporated territory of American Samoa (see map on page 50). It is here that the 23-year-old fledgling anthropologist Margaret Mead did her first field research some 58 years ago, arriving by boat from Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, about 70 miles across the South Pacific. She stayed for about half a year, and while clearly captivated by the people of Tau, she complained of the heat, which made it impossible for her to work for several hours at midday. Later, a devastating hurri-cane left only five houses standing in Luma and prevented her from interviewing villagers for several weeks on the island, a part of American Samoa.",SAMOA: A PARADISE LOST?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/samoa-a-paradise-lost.html

Tau, she declared, was ''ideal for my problem.'' Though the island had been entirely converted to Christianity some 80 years before her arrival, she found it still relatively untouched by Western culture. She wrote in her diary that the only papalagi (foreign) house on the entire island of 800 to 1,000 people was the dispensary in which she made her headquarters.

The few open-sided Samoan houses that remain are used more for ceremonial purposes than for actual dwellings. In Luma, each of the 26 extended families has large, American refrigerators and gas stoves, provided from the proceeds of communal bingo games. Most of the people of Tau, or at least those under 60, speak English. For each of the 2,000 people who live in Tau's villages, at least one Samoan is working abroad, either through service in the United States Army or jobs in such American states as Hawaii and California, and sending back money. (After establishing residency in the states, a large number of the villagers, an estimated one in eight, have become naturalized American citizens.)

Dr. Mead's classic book, ''Coming of Age in Samoa,'' published in 1928, left the West with a deep impression of Samoa as a place of gentle primitiveness. In describing the inhabitants of Manua, particularly its teen-age girls, as free of many of the tensions and anxieties that afflict the inhabitants of more technically advanced and complicated societies, Dr. Mead argued for the supremacy of environment, the importance of cultural nurturing over biology, as the formative factor in human development.",SAMOA: A PARADISE LOST?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/samoa-a-paradise-lost.html

Dr. Freeman contends that society in Samoa is rigid and hierarchical. In Dr. Mead's Manua, adolescent girls took lovers casually and joyfully, without guilt, postponing marriage so they could enjoy multiple affairs for as long as possible.

Adams, who spent nearly three months in Samoa in 1890 and 1891 and who called the Samoans the ''happiest, easiest, smilingest people I ever saw,'' believed that the encroachments of the West, the missionaries, the money economy, the commercial coconut planters, were already in the process of ruining Samoa. ''Another generation,'' he wrote in a letter, ''will leave behind it the finest part of the Samoan world.'' To be sure, the image of paradise in some writers -Herman Melville is one example - was tempered by concurrent images of darkness, by an awareness of deceit and cruelty in primitive South Sea societies. But even a brooding writer like Melville described the islands as lands of ease and plenty. Similarly, Rupert Brooke, perhaps the most enchanted of foreign visitors to Samoa, found the South Sea islands in general, and Samoa in particular, to be ''these forgotten -and dissolving - pieces of heaven.''",SAMOA: A PARADISE LOST?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/samoa-a-paradise-lost.html

But the body of literature, plus the testimony of some Samoans, suggests rather strongly that the anthropological laboratory called Samoa was once at least simpler, less riven by social tensions, less cluttered by Western artifacts than it is today.

Harriet Walter fills out the conception by playing the role with a galvanizing mixture of intense feeling (too tremulously so early on) and flaming determination.

While he opens the evening with a couple waltzing rhapsodically in the wintry light, the closing waltz for Bertram and Helena pointedly breaks that promise: the ostensibly reconciled lovers pull apart from each other in mid-step and walk side by side but separately into the dark.

Jill is poised, popular, a little aloof and hoping to be a star performer some day; in line with this, she stars triumphantly in a high-school play and practices singing ''Stop! In the Name of Love!'' in front of the mirror in her bedroom. As for Sheik, he's a sharp dresser with a passionate devotion to Frank Sinatra.

Jill, who is played crisply and confidently by Miss Arquette, fits more comfortably into Mr. Sayles's scheme, as a headstrong girl who begins to lose her bearings as the story moves on. But Sheik, though he's made powerful and sympathetic by Mr. Spano, seems perpetually ready to drift out of the movie entirely.

Jackson, accused of the stabbing death of a drug dealer following an argument over a small amount of marijuana in 1980, did not contest the resulting charge of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced in 1982 to a year in jail. He was released eight months later, but only after he had turned the ordeal into an advantage. Described at his trial as a functional illiterate, Jackson studied in jail and improved his reading from seventh grade level to 10th. That same determination won over Boston's coach, Dick Coury. ''He has a great attitude and works very hard,'' said Coury. For Jackson, the payoff of his dreams came right before the team prayer.

A spokesman for the Government said that it ''regards with concern the massive and hitherto unprecedented manner in which the Soviet Union is interfering in the election and the internal politics of the Federal Republic of Germany.'' (Page 1, Column 1.) The United States has been hurt abroad among its allies by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's refusal to endorse the nomination of Kenneth L. Adelman as United States arms control chief, President Reagan said. He said the committee was ''very irresponsible'' in its refusal Thursday to endorse his nominee. He vowed to ''do everything I can'' to win approval of the nomination on the Senate floor.

At the third of round of talks that were over in only three hours, the South African representatives apparently made the point that Angola would be reponsible for curtailing the military activities of South-West Africa People's Organization if a cease-fire were to hold. (3:1.) National A jobs emergency bill was approved by the House Appropriations Committee in the first step toward passing such legislation. The $4.6 billion package is a supplementary appropriation for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The bill is scheduled for debate on the House floor next week. Congressional leaders hope to have it on President Reagan's desk by mid-March. (1:6.) A study of the E.P.A.'s management by a professor of political economy is being considered by President Reagan, a senior White House official said. Prof. David F. Linowes of the University of Illinois may head a special committee to recommend changes in the Environmental Protection Agency that might prevent the troubles that have led to investigations by a half-dozen Congressional committees and the Justice Department. (1:5.) The prime lending rate was cut by several of the nation's major banks by half a percentage point, to 10 1/2 percent, the lowest level since November 1978. They responded to intense pressure by the Reagan Administration for lower bank interest rates. Most of the nation's banks are expected to join the cut next week. (1:2.) A strain on the V.A.'s medical funds is threatened by the number of War II veterans who will soon reach the age of 65, making them eligible for free medical care. Most of the 11.5 million veterans of the war will reach that age within the next few years. (1:6.) Curtailment of the Supreme Court in decisions regarding access to abortion and other issues might be tolerated by President Reagan's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services. This was indicated by the nominee, Margaret M. Heckler, who hinted at Senate confirmation hearings that she might tolerate Congressional efforts to strip the Court of its power to decide, in addition to abortion, such issues as school prayer and the use of busing in school desegretation. Senators of both parties pleaded with Mrs. Heckler to give some assurance that she would resist proposals to curtial the Court's power, but she declined to do so. (7:1.) Tennessee Williams died in Manhattan. The playwright was found dead in his apartment at a hotel. Officials said death was due to natural causes and that he had been treated for heart disease.

His newspapers reflected his views on internationalism, education and religious tolerance. (11:3.) Metropolitan 99-cents-a-gallon gasoline is back in the New York area and other parts of the nation for the first time in four years. Dealers say they expect prices to continue to fall. In Texas, some stations are selling regular gasoline at 95 cents a gallon. In Oregon, prices are as low as 89 cents a gallon. The factors in the price decline, according to dealers and analysts, are that people are driving less, cars are more efficient, gasoline supplies are plentiful and world oil prices are falling. (1:3.) Mayor Koch's work camp program for felons convicted of minor crimes is faltering. Last May, the Mayor said he hoped that up to 9,000 quality-of-life criminals - including three-card monte players, small-time marijuana sellers and turnstile jumpers - would be sent to the camps. However, between last September, when the program began, and the end of January, only 338 such offenders served sentences in a camp. (1:1.) School officials have not complied with a court order to provide handicapped pupils in New York City schools with special-education programs and services, a Federal judge ruled. Judge Eugene H. Nickerson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who issued the order three years ago, instructed a magistrate in his court to determine the extent to which the officials and their subordinates ''are now in contempt of this court's judgement'' on key issues.
