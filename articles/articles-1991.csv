Even so, Washington, having broken the Japanese diplomatic code, knew that matters were approaching a crisis. On Nov. 27, Adm. Harold R. Stark, the chief of naval operations, sent out a war warning to the Pacific Fleet commander at Pearl Harbor, Adm. Husband E. Kimmel. Somehow convinced that a naval assault on Hawaii was beyond the imagination or capability of the Japanese, Kimmel and his Army counterpart, Lieut. Gen. Walter C. Short, interpreted the alert as a warning to beware of sabotage, and they bunched their aircraft so sentries would have an easy time of it. The fleet, Mr. van der Vat writes, continued its peacetime cruising routine, which permitted frequent weekends in port. Japan's naval aviators found many of the Americans literally asleep at Pearl Harbor.

34800,1991-11-03,nyt://article/973fb9a7-8603-5494-8697-9ff29ad30539,2.0,"If Warren E. Buffett, the interim chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc., is right, the firm's problems are due to an overly generous compensation scheme. In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett said the securities unit, which illegally bought too many Treasury bonds, earned only about 10 percent on its equity capital, not a stellar showing. But ""106 individuals who worked for the unit earned $1 million or more,"" he wrote. He told shareholders bonuses would be scaled back when the current plan runs out. The firm will offer stock, not just cash. That would encourage executives to think of the shareholder. Other firms might copy that. But some others think the plan is dubious. ""When the current bonus plan pays out on Dec. 31,"" said Graef S. Crystal, author of ""In Search of Excess,"" ""Unless there is recession on the Street, there is likely to be a hemorrhage of talent."" A few defections may be part of the plan. Chrysler Starts to Look Better When a car company loses $82 million in the third quarter, it usually signals that something big -- like sales -- has fizzled. Investors walk away. But this is no ordinary quarter. In fact, it is no ordinary year. Analysts predict Detroit's Big Three will lose $5 billion before it's over. That made the Chrysler Corporation's bleak numbers look good last week -- at least by comparison. ""In the market we're in today, holding losses to $82 million is an outstanding performance and clearly reflects the efficiencies we've gained by restructuring Chrysler,"" said Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman. Wall Street agreed. Part of Chrysler's performance came when it sold its half interest in Diamond Star Motors to the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan for $99.75 million. Its stock -- which had been languishing -- rose $1.625 to $12.75 on the announcements and closed the week at $12.50. Time Warner's Japan Connection Last week, Steven J. Ross, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., made good on a promise to find foreign partners. The Toshiba Corporation and C. Itoh & Company of Japan said they will invest $1 billion in Time Warner. That gives the companies a 12.5 percent stake in a limited partnership called Time Warner Entertainment and cuts some of Time Warner's $8.8 billion in debt. Perhaps most important, the deal gives Time Warner opportunities in Japan. ""Beyond valuation, the goal is to create a strategic partnership to get distribution in Japan,"" said Harold J. Levy, vice president of Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Inc., an investment bank in New York. Boeing Has a Hit on Its Hands Although it has never flown, the Boeing Company's mid-sized 777 is already a hit with the airlines. Last week Japan Airlines ordered 20 of the new twin-engine jets.

A Computer That's Still Growing Last week the Thinking Machines Corporation unveiled its latest number-crunching supercomputer. It's a monster. The massively parallel machine -- so called because it divides up problems among a number of simple processors -- snaps together like a set of Legos. It can stroll along with 32 processors, or roar with 16,000. Each chip can be connected to four math-processor chips. That makes the CM-5 one of the few supercomputers that can grow. Although most customers are research labs, the American Express Company said it would take two CM-5's, but was mum about what it would do with all that power. Burying the B-2 The Northrop Corporation received a blow from Congress last week. Northrop makes the B-2 Stealth bomber. The B-2's mission is now moot since it was designed to sneak past Soviet radar defense with its load of bombs. Congress made it difficult for the Pentagon to order any more B-2's this fiscal year beyond the 15 being built. Each plane costs $865 million. Extra Innings, but Not Revenues Two years ago, CBS bet heavily on baseball. It paid $1.06 billion for the right to show major league games. But it still lost money last year. This year (aside from the weekend of the Clarence Thomas saga) the fans tuned in to the World Series as never before. Minnesota and Atlanta cooperated by going seven games, three with extra innings. That brought CBS $35 million in extra revenue since more commercials could be shown. Game seven scored 32.1 ratings points -- impressive since each point represents 921,000 homes. But CBS still lost $169.1 million in the third quarter, its worst ever.

Yeltsin, President of the Russian Republic, said it was time to act ""decisively, sternly, without hesitation."" He told the highest assembly in the Russian Republic that he intended to lift most price controls (not vodka) at the end of the year. He also said he would accelerate the privatization of agriculture and some light industries and that he would stop financing the central Government's ministries -- excluding the military, transportation and energy. The central Government is what President Mikhail S. Gorbachev runs. It sounded as if Mr. Yeltsin had a plan. It also sounded as if he recognized how much disruption the leap into a market economy would cause. The Congress approved the proposals 876 to 16. Trading Barbs Last week Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, talked tough to the European Community. She admonished it for the generous way it continues to subsidize its farmers. She said Europe's farmers were ""killing the land."" That part -- killing the land -- was in response to assertions by European officials that the Bush Administration does not care about the environment. The Europeans want rules banning trade that harms the environment, something Ms. Hills would rather not see. A New Leader for Japan 1Last week it became official. Kiichi Miyazawa was chosen as Japan's next Prime Minister. Mr. Miyazawa is more than an adept politician. He once was Finance Minister and before that represented Japan in important trade negotiations with the United States. Though he is thought to want better relations with Washington, when it comes to trade he still must wrestle with powerful interest groups at home. ""He is superbly qualified,"" said Jeffrey E. Garten, managing director of the Blackstone Group. ""But it is still not clear what freedom of action he will have.""

The economy expanded by an estimated 2.4 percent in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That increase, though meager, was the first positive showing in a year. But those gains did not come from the sectors economists are very fond of; they came from shifts in inventories. ""Inventory changes up or down are no basis for sustained growth,"" said Robert Ortner, the author of ""Voodoo Deficits."" Sustained growth comes from capital spending. ""As rebounds go, this is puny,"" he said. Sheepish Consumers Right now, the consumer is more lamb than lion. The Conference Board's Index of Consumer Confidence tumbled in October to a nervous 60.4, down from 72.9 in September. The index was a self-confident 100 in 1985. The fall in confidence is important since jittery consumers don't spend. Last month's reading was the worst since the 1981-82 recession. Negative Foreshadowing It wasn't exactly a leap, but it was worrisome just the same. Unemployment rose to 6.8 percent in October, up from 6.7 in September, the Labor Department said last week. ""That suggests a negative fourth quarter,"" said Alan Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. There was also a fall in the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators. The index, which is used to forecast the economy six to nine months in the future, fell 0.1 percent in September, the first drop since February. ""That suggests a negative prognosis for the first quarter,"" he said. ""I read these numbers as recession threatening,"" he said. The Price of Pot-Smoking Economists are fond of building mental models of how the world works. If demand falls, they say, prices usually tumble. But if demand stays down, prices often rise to compensate for lost economies of scale as sellers go out of business. That is the way the market works. But what about the underground market? Demand for marijuana is down sharply, according to a report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington. Yet prices are higher than ever. What cost $20 an ounce a decade ago, sells for $800. The high prices suggest pot has lost its allure. ""If it goes up much more I'm going to stop smoking,"" one smoker told The Times. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly survey showed the pace of growth slackened in October. The survey fell to 53.5 from 55 in September.",Business Diary/October 27 - November 1,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/03/business/business-diary-october-27-november-1.html

The Keep is eventually bought by Hugh Montague, whose C.I.A. code name is Harlot -- unusual, but then Hugh is altogether extraordinary -- where he lives with Kittredge and their young son, Christopher. Hugh has not only taught Harry, who is his C.I.A. colleague Cal Hubbard's son, how to climb rocks; he has also watched over Harry's career at the Agency. Harry worships him, but he is also consumed with love for Kittredge, who in some strange, perverse but platonic way responds and flirts with him. Years have gone by, and Kittredge has become Harry's mistress.

He has not only thoroughly done his homework (in an appendix he lists 80 odd relevant books he has perused), he has also integrated that material with his own inventions.

In Tangier, where a room with a view could be rented for 50 cents a night and a three-course meal purchased for a dollar, expatriates could live like pigs or pashas. Barbara Hutton, the much-married Woolworth heiress, provided theatrical fetes for her friends at her Casbah mansion that included belly dancers, camel drivers and nomadic tribesmen called ""blue people,"" whose skin was tinted by the indigo dye in their robes. But the spectacle of abundance in the souks was extraordinary, and Ms. Green makes us feel the joy of color and design: ""The sheer bounty was astonishing; wild artichokes, fennel, avocados, eggplant, tomatoes and peppers were arranged in artful heaps; great shining pyramids of oil-cured olives . . . palettes of spices -- dusty-green cumin, yellow-orange cayenne, scarlet paprika -- were mounded in white enameled bowls.

Fear, not frolic, was in the air, and many of those who had made a legend of Western decadence decamped for safer havens. But the Bowleses stayed on. After his collection of stories ""A Hundred Camels in the Courtyard"" was published in 1962, Paul Bowles became the high priest of the potheads and what he dubbed ""the Eighth-Streetniks"" who came, so he quipped, ""to speculate not in money but in the metaphysical condition of North Africa."" Jane Bowles, characterizing the town as ""an elephant's graveyard,"" became one of its most celebrated victims. Having spent a lifetime making a legend of regrets, she ended her days terrorized by her Arab lover, who tried to poison her, and deranged by a series of strokes. Madness and self-destruction are the subtext of much of the weird liberation from self-consciousness that life in Tangier conjured. Jane Bowles died blind and mute in 1973; but Paul Bowles lives on in the country he has mythologized for the West. ""Tangier,"" Ms. Green quotes him as saying, ""is like a gong that rang [40] years ago, and I still hear the resonance."" This well-researched and well-written book uses the louche expatriate lives of the Tangerinos -- as the foreign residents were called -- as threads to make a tapestry of the place over those 40 years.

On this grim January morning, however, his thoughts are elsewhere: he considers the idea of killing himself or, more mundanely, skipping the conference so he can tell his wife that he's leaving her. Not a particularly auspicious beginning, you might think. Yet ""An Explanation of the Birds"" turns out to be a dazzling tragicomic portrait of an indecisive dreamer floundering about in the political chaos of the 1970's, in the aftermath of the longtime dictatorship of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar.",Coming Unglued in Lisbon,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/18/books/coming-unglued-in-lisbon.html

But she tired of him and abruptly dumped him, taking possession of their two children, along with hefty alimony provided by Rui's father. Rui was cast adrift, until he found purpose -- at least temporarily -- in radical politics. Then one day he was arrested for writing anti-Government graffiti on buildings. His father bailed him out of jail, but not before being so humiliated by a police officer that he abandoned hope for his son, finally acknowledging all the embarrassments Rui had made him suffer. But Rui's arrest hardly earned him the devotion of the party; despite his activism, the members of his Communist cell still considered him untrustworthy and incurably bourgeois. In a vain attempt to prove his loyalty, he took up with Marilia, a sour, unattractive Communist of peasant stock. Marilia, now his second wife, despises Rui's family and everything they represent.

The narration moves swiftly in and out of Rui's memories and imaginings, and in the process its portrait of this suicidal man achieves shape and depth.

It occurred when Rui and his father were taking a walk at the family farm and a flock of birds suddenly flew up from a chestnut tree. ""Explain the birds to me,"" said the young boy.

In 1974 Malcolm and Evelyn Graham had sailed to the Pacific island of Palmyra, planning a long and solitary stay. At the same time another couple, Buck Walker and Jennifer Jenkins, also planned a lengthy visit to the supposedly deserted atoll. The two couples were oil and sea water. The Grahams were wealthy, their superb boat stocked with sterling, crystal and fine food. Buck Walker, an ex-convict, planned to make his living by farming marijuana on Palmyra. The Grahams mysteriously disappeared; Mr. Walker and Ms. Jenkins later resurfaced in Hawaii on the Grahams' repainted boat. Six years later the remains of Evelyn Graham -- a skull with a gold tooth in it -- were found on the Palmyra beach. A jury quickly convicted Buck Walker of murder. ""And the Sea Will Tell"" tells how Mr. Bugliosi successfully defended Jennifer Jenkins on a murder charge. The circumstances of the crime are intriguing, and Mr. Bugliosi and his co-author, Bruce B. Henderson, the author of ""Empire of Deceit,"" milk the situation -- if this were fiction the story would zoom right off the plausibility meter. While insisting on absolute truth in the courtroom, however, Mr. Bugliosi seems less than open with the reader. When did he decide to write this book? He says the defense money was almost gone before he signed on, so how was he reimbursed during the four years he worked on the case?

At that time, all of New England as well as many other states prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages. This was followed by an upsurge in drinking, which peaked in 1890. Then Americans began to turn against alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. In 1920, the nation prohibited the sale of alcohol. Prohibition ended in 1933 in part, Dr. Musto said, because the Federal Government wanted the revenue it could raise by taxing alcoholic beverages.
