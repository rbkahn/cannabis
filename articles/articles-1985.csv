I could have scored at the top of those magazine tests that list the greatest stresses of life, for that year saw the dissolution of a seven-year relationship with the woman I had fully expected to live with the rest of my life, I ran out of money, left the work I was doing, the house I owned, and the city I was living in, and attended the funeral of my father in May and my mother in November.",RETURNING TO CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/magazine/returning-to-church.html

It brought a sense of relief, and sometimes I recited it in my mind in the months that followed, but it did not give me any sense that I suddenly believed in God. It simply seemed an isolated source of solace and calm, such as any great poem might be. It certainly did not give rise to the notion of anything as radical as going to church. After my Christmas Eve experience at King's Chapel, I didn't get up the nerve to go back again until Easter. I did not have any attacks of shivering or chills in the spring sunshine of that service, so it seemed that even as a ''latecomer'' and former avowed atheist, I could safely enter a place regarded as a house of God. Still, the prospect was discomforting. My two initial trips of return had been on major holidays, occasions when ''regular'' people went to church, simply in observance of tradition. To go back again meant crossing the Boston Common on a nonholiday Sunday morning wearing a suit and tie, a giveaway sign of churchgoing. I did it furtively, as if I were engaged in something that would not be approved of by my peers. I hoped they would all be home doing brunch and the Sunday papers, so I would not be ''caught in the act.'' I recalled the remark of William F.

I had simply assumed I did not know people who went to church, yet here they were, with intellects intact, worshiping God. Once inside the church myself, I understood the appeal. No doubt my friends and neighbors found, as I did, relief and refreshment in connecting with age-old rituals, reciting psalms and singing hymns. There was a calm reassurance in the stately language of the litanies and chants of the Book of Common Prayer.

I noticed in the church bulletin an announcement of a Bible-study class in the parish house, and I went one stormy autumn evening to find myself with only the church's young seminarian on hand and one other parishioner. Rather than being disappointed by the tiny turnout, as I ordinarily would have been, I thought of the words ''Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them,'' and I felt an interior glow that the pouring rain outside and occasional claps of thunder only made seem more vital and precious.

The first scripture passage I was assigned to lead was from Luke, about the man who cleans his house of demons, and seven worse ones come. I did not have any trouble relating this to ''contemporary life.'' It sounded unnervingly like an allegory about a man who had stopped drinking and so was enjoying much better health, but took up smoking marijuana to ''relax,'' all the while feeling good and even self-righteous about giving up the booze. It was my own story. I realized, with a shock, how I'd been deceiving myself, how much more ''housecleaning'' I had to do. I WAS NOT ONLY GOING to church and devoting time to Bible study and prayer during this period, I was actively engaged in purely secular programs of physical and mental therapy and ''personal growth'' to try to pull myself out of the pit I found myself in when I fled home to Boston in the spring of 1980. I got into an Exercycle and diet program that in six months cut my pulse rate from a dangerously stress-induced 120 to a healthy 60, and shed 20 pounds.

The Magnificat is a grand, festive work, with drums and trumpets; it is interesting to note that despite the smaller forces none of the grandeur is lost.

Alex has just decided to take up painting after a 20-year hiatus. Kate is about to take his job teaching art classes, which she has never done. This is the kind of family where dad asks daughter for some of her marijuana and she says, ''Have a good time''; where the decision of ''an odd little boy'' to go to law school is regarded as ''a waste of his spiritual nature''; and where mother and daughter invent an impromptu magic ritual using kitchen herbs.

There is dialogue but no conversations; as if everyone were stoned, reactions are weirdly delayed or skewed. Nothing happens, even though there are ostensible events, because the family is subsumed by a myopic view that has the earnest smugness of someone murmuring to a hysteric, ''Go with the flow.''",IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-fiction-155418.html

Kennedy seemed to put the progressive house in order, and assassination did not interfere with this, for Johnson eagerly took up the torch, But flaws in his temperament, entaglement in Indochina and consequent turmoil diverted liberal energies.

To say that this artist has continued to grow in the decade since then is to abridge the story drastically. In Act II of ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' her new show at the Plymouth, we find that Miss Tomlin and her longtime collaborator, the writer and director Jane Wagner, are attempting what might well be considered their own theatrical update to Mr. Altman's epic. They treat the audience to an idiosyncratic, rude, blood-stained comedy about American democracy and its discontents - and, this time around, Miss Tomlin plays all the parts herself.",The Stage: Lily Tomlin In 'Search for Signs',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/theater/the-stage-lily-tomlin-in-search-for-signs.html

While Miss Tomlin's chameleon-like ability to inhabit a wide range of personalities is not news to those who saw her previous Broadway recital, the 1977 ''Appearing Nitely,'' this time she knits her creations (almost all of them new) into what can rightly be called a play. What's more, the script is nearly as daring as Miss Tomlin's single-handed assault on it. As the star trails like a comet through a galaxy of characters - with no props, costume changes or scenery for artificial propulsion - so Miss Wagner attempts to sum up a generation of social history in a tightly compressed saga of a few representative lives. Even the occasional blurring of Miss Tomlin's characterizations and the fitful melodramatics of Miss Wagner's writing can't diminish the fact that Act II of ''The Search for Signs'' is original, not to mention absorbing, theater.",The Stage: Lily Tomlin In 'Search for Signs',https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/theater/the-stage-lily-tomlin-in-search-for-signs.html

It's a radical critique not only of the national status quo but also of some activists who have fought (ineffectually, in the author's view) for change. In telling the story of a California feminist named Lynn over a period that begins with the birth of Ms. magazine and ends with Geraldine Ferraro's ascension to the Democratic ticket, Miss Tomlin and Miss Wagner make equal sport of men and women (hetero- and homosexual), liberals and reactionaries, rebellious multi-media peformance artists and middle-management corporate pawns. True, the bourgeois fashions of west Los Angeles and Marin County get hit particularly hard: Lynn and her husband live in a geodesic dome (built from a kit advertised in Mother Jones magazine) and enlist in every est-inspired training program going.

We also grow to like Lynn's best friends - Edie, a radical lesbian journalist whose newspaper is purchased by Rupert Murdoch, and Marge, who eventually discovers a most macabre outlet for her skill at macrame. Even Lynn's hypocritical husband, Bob, isn't a total loss.

Gordon Liddy's ''Will'' is the self-help bible of our time or that ''evolution works on the Peter Principle.''

Addicts are the principal route by which the disease passes into the general population. The number of such victims is small, but will soon reach significance if it keeps doubling each year.

To make needles freely available gives social sanction to a different deadly curse. The spread of AIDS through drug abuse may claim innocent victims -but so do the street crimes committed by addicts. How can cities ravaged by heroin condone its use? The medical case is entitled at least to presumptive, initial support. The issue is more needles, not more heroin. New York's law against the open sale of needles is a pragmatic barrier; lowering it before an overriding health concern does not weaken the moral stand against drug abuse.

The intelligent woman pondering spinsterhood. The imperious grande dame. The high-minded student and her married suitor, well into his midlife crisis. These and other characters familiar from Barbara Pym's later books assemble for the first time in this early work (1939-40), now published posthumously. As is ever the case in a Pym novel, the scope of the action is constricted but made compelling by understatement, an underlying sense of compassion and a precision of language through which mundane vocabulary is elevated into art. Crampton Hodnet is the name of a parish invented by the clergyman as an unnecessary alibi for an innocent walk in the woods, and it comes to signify all the imaginary excuses and rationalizations by which the book's inhabitants live. They watch themselves and each other closely, alert for any lapse of North Oxford decorum, and together preserve a world of interchangeable parts where no one is indispensable and equilibrium is maintained above all else. The novel is framed with three flirtations - two improbable, one predictable and all ultimately transitory. ''Falling in love is never ordinary to the people who indulge in it,'' a woman says, settling into her unmarried state. But passion implies a risk of uncertainty and is unstable; no character is capable of extricating him or herself sufficiently from past comforts or habits to indulge in passion for long.

In ''Shiloh,'' a 1982 collection of her short stories, Bobbie Ann Mason writes of a disabled former truck driver who smokes marijuana and has no interest in looking for other work. Raymond Carver has written stories, collected in ''Cathedral'' (1983), of the unemployed and the alcoholic. William Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Ironweed'' (1983) is among those books that longingly look back at labor history. But in Mr. Kennedy's 1930's, just as in novels set in the present, the theme is the disintegration of the unemployed. Similarly, in the South Philadelphia of Pete Dexter's ''God's Pocket'' (1984), violence joins with alcohol to form the essence of working-class life. These are chronicles of decline, not paeans to working-class heroes. I T is tempting to suggest that the current literary uninterest in workers is a reflection of the present atmosphere of political conservatism and that the mood is likely to pass if the pendulum swings back toward liberalism. There is, though, little in American literature's past treatment of workers to support such a view. Throughout most of this nation's history the industrial working class has been largely ignored in our fiction.

In 1904 the author wrote to his editor, ''The novel I plan would be intended to set forth the breaking of human hearts by a system which exploits the labor of men and women for profits.'' Although this romantic socialist was never a novelist of the first rank, ''The Jungle'' is a powerful evocation of working-class life.

For laborers, machinery may seem to be the enemy but, Steinbeck shows, the problem is of a different sort: ''Is the tractor bad? Is the power that turns the long furrows wrong?

He found it easier to disturb the consciences of Americans with novels about rural workers than Upton Sinclair had with his portrayal of urban immigrants in a meatpacking plant. Of course the vastly different economic circumstances between the time of ''The Jungle'' and that of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' partly explains the different reactions. In the Depression, readers were more receptive to literature about the working class simply because so many people were suffering.

The American Eden was, of course, founded in the wilderness. The Jeffersonian idea that American farmers were far superior to the urbanized masses of Europe became ingrained in American thought. Agriculture, it has usually been thought, is the truly American way of life; industry is ''foreign.'' This notion was reinforced in the later 19th and early 20th centuries when immigrants constituted so much of the urban working class. A MERICANS cherish the myth of success as much as they do the agrarian myth. It is permissible to be a laborer early in life, as long as you rise to better things later; but he who remains an industrial worker is seen by most Americans as unsuccessful. The heroes of the Horatio Alger stories rose from the working class, no one aspires to be a worker.",WORKERS IN FICTION: LOCKED OUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/books/workers-in-fiction-locked-out.html

The agrarian myth held that farmers were independent, though they are extraordinarily dependent on weather, world market fluctuations, transportation systems, interest rates and many other variables. But in the public mind, the farmer was what all Americans longed to be: independent and self-reliant. Not so the industrial worker; his complete dependence for his livelihood upon the owners of factories and machinery was apparent.",WORKERS IN FICTION: LOCKED OUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/books/workers-in-fiction-locked-out.html

Quite easily in reality, since most Americans fit these categories. But when we think of a ''real'' American, an industrial laborer does not come to mind. It seems odd that other forms of popular culture have of late done a better job than literature in depicting the problems of laborers. One thinks of such films as ''Norma Rae'' and ''The Deer Hunter,'' television's ''All in the Family,'' which on occasion at least showed sympathy for Archie Bunker. Popular musicians have also addressed the issue in their songs: Billy Joel's ''Allentown,'' Dire Straits' ''Industrial Disease'' and Bruce Springsteen in ''My Home Town.'' Perhaps the wider audience that exists for these cultural forms has a greater interest in the problems of labor than the much more limited group that buys books.",WORKERS IN FICTION: LOCKED OUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/01/books/workers-in-fiction-locked-out.html
