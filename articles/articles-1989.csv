The main narrative traces the efforts of Capt. Sylvester Nunes, a customs and excise officer, to impose his version of law and order on the village, which unaccountably survived without it before his arrival. Nunes is consumed with hatred and suspicion. ''Here,'' he tells a villager, ''here in my gut is the evidence that you are all committing a great crime.'' Nunes uses familiar South African police methods - interrogation, beating, a curfew, arbitrary detention, even the classification by ancestry of every villager and the introduction of racial segregation - but he finds no relief from his intestinal fires. ''He could feel the flames reaching into his chest, scorching the soft fabric of his lungs. In the darkness he could see sparks on his breath.''",LAW AND ORDER COME TO PARADISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/books/law-and-order-come-to-paradise.html

They suffer the captain's abuses, and they tell him long, strange stories that drive him wild. In their tales from the whaling era, the Anglo-Boer War and the genocidal campaign of the German general Lothar von Trotha against the Hereros (in what is today Namibia), the history of South Africa is interleaved with the history of the village. And the true ancestral mix of the place is revealed in accounts of successive settlement by early hunter-gatherers, Portuguese shipwreck survivors, Norwegian whalers and Filipino fishermen.",LAW AND ORDER COME TO PARADISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/books/law-and-order-come-to-paradise.html

It has its share of stormy and unpleasant characters, and the sharp alternation of good times and lean strains the community's fabric. In fact, it is a cycle of unparalleled prosperity, and the consequent arrival of modern consumer goods to the village, that ultimately bring Captain Nunes down on the heads of the inhabitants. From these events Mr. Nicol spins a parable about the perils of commodity fetishism that is at least as compelling as the more pointed allegory about the apartheid state, represented by Captain Nunes. When the village soothsayer warns against replacing the local marijuana and sweet melon wine with imported liquor and inveighs against ''tinned peas, dark chocolate, sherbet, jams, tea that is not made of hard leaves,'' the literary resonances reach all the way to Genesis.",LAW AND ORDER COME TO PARADISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/books/law-and-order-come-to-paradise.html

King was thrust upon him at birth by a mother who ''firmly believed that a child lived up to or down to his name,'' and Sarcowicz is regularly and derisively corrupted to ''Sauerkraut'' by virtually everyone he meets.

King is the stereotypical computer nerd who has become all too common in fiction, an absent-minded fellow whose social ineptitude is surpassed only by his physical awkwardness. Oddly, it is this very nerdiness, central to the story, that strikes the falsest note in the book: we never see any evidence that Sarcowicz is in fact the genius everyone proclaims him to be. And, more important, he is all too aware of his failings, an awareness that belies his supposed lack of social perception. Compounding this problem is the sad fact that Ms. Paul's story really isn't very interesting. Several bizarre deaths do occur when Sarcowicz and his business partner arrive, together with two software developers with whom they have formed an uneasy alliance, in New York in order to obtain a massive defense contract.

Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, it appeared the nation's highest bench was about to gain a first-rate mind, a scholar who would give intellectual substance to its decisions.

Senator Edward Kennedy claimed Judge Bork would force women to resort to ''back-alley abortions,'' reinstitute segregated lunch counters, deny children the opportunity to learn about evolution and allow ''rogue police . . .

In a concluding chapter where the author's emotions heat up a bit, ''Why the Campaign Was Mounted,'' he spells out the reasons ''the intellectual left reacts with fury when its influence with the courts is threatened.'' Frustrated by a democratic process in which they have little voting power, alienated from a middle-class public and out of touch with younger career-minded students, veterans of the 60's, he charges, have become an adversarial vanguard fighting public-interest causes in the courts and law schools. Judge Bork quotes one professor who admits that ''many of us entered law teaching with liberal or even radical views and the faith that legal scholarship and law teaching would enable us to translate our values into social reform.''

Mr. Levinson has explained that ''for a Nietzschean reader of constitutions there is no point in searching for a code that will produce 'truthful' or 'correct' interpretations; instead the interpreter, in [ the philosopher Richard ] Rorty's words, 'simply beats the text into a shape which will serve his own purpose.'

The post-modernist philosopher insists that acts of judgment are simply means of domination, and Nietzsche tells us that we impose our interpretations, dressing them up as discoveries so that our claims to truth conceal our will to power. Judges, hold thy tongue! Yet Judge Bork wants judges to speak out for a strict interpretation of the Constitution that favors restraint over activism.

But surely Lincoln, Taney's antagonist, was reading into the Constitution his own egalitarian values when he claimed that the Declaration of Independence radiates as the moral emblem of the Republic. In ways that a post-modernist would appreciate, Lincoln read the Constitution against itself in order to show that the framers had deliberately repressed all mention of slaves as human beings who, according to the Declaration, were entitled to equality as a natural right.

Judge Bork seems to trust society to provide the basis for order and civility, and he asks the courts to acquiesce in the sentiments of popular majorities whose passions the framers distrusted. But some of us agree with the framers that to leave truth to the decisions of a democracy is to leave it to chance, just as leaving rights to the judgment of popular opinion could entrust them to the tyranny of the majority. Judge Bork may be correct to insist that judges have no authority to impose their views on us. But if there was one thing such framers of the Constitution as Madison, Hamilton and Adams agreed on, it was that the people themselves are not the best guardians of their own liberties and rights. Judge Bork's book reminds us that the question they wrestled with remains a question for us today: Do we leave our rights to the hopeful wisdom of the courts or to the elusive whim of the masses?

Bork, the Reagan Administration had fulfilled a campaign pledge of reshaping the United States judiciary. It succeeded in appointing three conservatives to Supreme Court vacancies and filling more than half of all the other Federal judgeships around the nation with little opposition from the Senate. No nominee was able to shake the nation into a meaningful debate on the role of the courts in American society. All that changed on a warm July day in 1987 with the announcement that Judge Bork was the President's choice to succeed Lewis F. Powell Jr. - who, as the swing man of the Supreme Court, was perhaps the most powerful Justice of his time. On that day, there was little sign that this nominee would be any different from the others. Aside from Senator Edward Kennedy, in a vitriolic speech, no one predicted that Judge Bork would ultimately lose in the Senate, and by the largest margin ever suffered by a Supreme Court nominee. What happened? It is the thesis of THE PEOPLE RISING: The Campaign Against the Bork Nomination (Thunder's Mouth, Cloth $24.95, Paper $13.95) that while Judge Bork ultimately did himself in - he left an ample paper trail of criticism of the Court's most important decisions in civil rights, privacy and the First Amendment - it was the trumpeting of the Bork record through a rare coalition, the likes of which had not been seen at any other time in the 1980's, that aroused such violent hostility toward his nomination. That coalition included abortion rights, civil rights, feminist, labor, environmental and senior citizen organizations, which were able to put aside their differences to forge the block-Bork movement. Michael Pertschuk, a liberal lobbyist and a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Wendy Schaetzel, a journalist, have put together a political manifesto. It weaves together internal memos with portraits of the coalition's organizers, providing an insightful guide to the campaign against the Bork nomination. ''The People Rising'' refutes the notion that Judge Bork's opponents were narrow special-interest groups lacking substantive objections, and ably shows that through some tense moments during the four-month campaign, the group was able to reach critical agreements on framing the issues, sharing lists of constituencies and avoiding testimony after Judge Bork's own fatal appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The authors also attempt to refute accusations that the coalition was unfair and underhanded by documenting how carefully Judge Bork's opponents relied on controversial writings by the nominee himself. Indeed, the book succeeds in demonstrating that it was the writings and ruminations of Judge Bork, as much as anything else, that defeated his nomination. ''The People Rising'' is a useful chronicle, not only of the players who helped beat Judge Bork, but also of the manipulation of symbols used against a White House that thought it had a monopoly on that art.

Experts believe smoking crack causes the brain to produce a surge of dopamine, a neurotransmitter. That stimulates a high, followed by a low to be alleviated by another rush of dopamine as it is smoked again. Repeated smoking eventually depletes the brain's dopamine supply.

No character in the novel comes right out and says, for example, that writers exist (at least to readers) only in their writing, that each person (at least to himself) is his own fiction, that the writer's imagination can feel alien to him, a possessing and possessive demon, a Dracula arisen to prey on the whole man and his family. Nor does anyone in the novel say outright that reality inevitably leaks fiction, which then floods reality, that reality and fiction feed on and feed each other, that they are at war yet they are twins - so identical that attempts to say which is which only lead to more fictions.

At the end, the decent family man wins out, but at a cost - which is how it should be.

Working out of a fortresslike house in the heart of the inner city, the Jamaicans had employed an estimated 1,000 people at one point. Demand was so great that the posse had had to import Jamaicans from New York and Miami. This proved to be its undoing. The new workers felt little loyalty to the group, and, when arrested, tended to talk, providing the task force with invaluable information. In late 1986, the Feds struck, raiding ghetto crack houses and rounding up dealers. Eventually, 178 traffickers were prosecuted and 25 more deported.

Finishing Madison Jones's eighth novel is like waking up from someone else's nightmare - or maybe being released from someone else's paranoid fantasy. That's because, although the fears that materialize in ''Last Things'' may not be anything like the reader's own, they still have a scary, spiky grip. As ''Last Things'' begins, Wendell Corbin has returned, against his better judgment, to his birthplace in the Deep South, the ironically named Bliss County. Here he intends to take up graduate studies with Leonard T. Rathbone, who, like Wendell, is a zonked-out fan of both William Blake and marijuana. But as quick as you can say cannabis, Wendell, who had done some dealing in his undergraduate days, is set up in a drug sale and given the chance, as a condition of his release by the corrupt arresting officers, to become a soldier in the illegal drug-running operation of a local businessman, Jason Farrow. Wendell's assignments include getting rid of a busybody who happens to have guessed what Farrow is up to and is also, conveniently enough, the hateful mother-in-law of Tricia Harker, a Nietzsche-obsessed woman that Wendell has taken up with. Wendell's uneasiness over his illicit activities eventually prevails, and he blows the whistle on the chicanery - but without producing quite the results he had intended. Although ''Last Things'' ends as an exploration of what can happen when middle-class morality is flouted, it begins as if it's going to be another satire of academia. But although there's a shift of gears midway, going from first to second certainly gives ''Last Things'' a surge of giddy power.",FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/books/university-presses-in-short-fiction-740489.html

Although he was forever pitching his tent somewhere new, he was not exactly a ''travel writer''; the phrase irritated him because it suggested too insular an attitude toward the planet. Home was everywhere. All countries, in his mind, shared a common frontier. And the people he ran into on his travels were usually eccentric, improbable and exotic, whether they lived in the groomed drawing rooms of France or slept under an arbor of stars in so-called primitive lands. Before he died in January, from what he described as ''a very rare Chinese fungus of the bone marrow,'' he put together ''What Am I Doing Here,'' a miscellaneous collection of his travel essays, reminiscences and fiction that contains some of his finest writing.",HOME WAS WHERE THE ROAD WAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/books/home-was-where-the-road-was.html

But by now the writer's illness had left him too frail to walk and climb stairs. He needed a wheelchair, but there was no way to haul one through the jungle. Instead, as Chatwin reports in ''Werner Herzog in Ghana,'' the director offered to provide him with ''four hammockeers and a sunshade bearer,'' and the ceremonial suavity of the gesture was impossible to refuse. Chatwin went, and took notes, sketching a wonderfully zany portrait of Mr. Herzog, a contradictory man with a ''laughing-skull tattoo on his shoulder,'' a mystical belief in ''the sacramental aspect of walking'' and an apparent penchant for organized disorder. ''The Viceroy of Ouidah,'' which concerns one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Brazilian-African slave trade, calls for a re-created 19th-century African court, but Mr. Herzog decided to use an actual contemporary African court instead, hiring the king and his subjects as actors and treating them with ''old-fashioned Germanic courtliness.''",HOME WAS WHERE THE ROAD WAS,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/books/home-was-where-the-road-was.html

So, for example, we are to understand that ''The Songlines,'' though generally true, has some fictional elements in it - only we don't know where exactly or how many.

But many of the essays in ''What Am I Doing Here'' are examples of Chatwin at his best - part observer, part interviewer, part scholar.

The fruit of that work, ''The Cocaine Kids,'' provides a remarkable close-up view of the drug trade in New York's Spanish Harlem. Mr. Williams, a senior scholar at the Center for Social Research at the City University of New York, and a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation grant to study the culture of housing projects, is clearly a warm and engaging man who earned the trust of the crew of seven young men and one woman. They allowed him to observe them as they cut, mixed and sold their illicit wares. They knew he was taking notes on their lives and they let him know their secrets. In return, he ''was kind of a big brother, able to help with homework and even babysitting, but most of all a willing and sympathetic listener.''",ON THE STREETS WHERE THEY LIVE AND DIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/books/on-the-streets-where-they-live-and-die.html

The current prevalence of crack - base cocaine - is a result of a 1983 cocaine supply glut in foreign countries that led to price cuts and the search for new consumers; the centrality of teen-agers in today's drug economy is a result of vastly harsher penalties for drug traders over the age of 18.",ON THE STREETS WHERE THEY LIVE AND DIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/books/on-the-streets-where-they-live-and-die.html

They were roughly, angrily drawn, suggesting both Picasso's and Francis Picabia's works from the 1920's and something of German Expressionism. But nothing precisely like the ''Three Studies'' had been seen before. Bacon's tortured and menacing figures seemed to capture perfectly the anguished, claustrophobic spirit of war-ravaged England. At a time when painting in Britain, like so much else, had become enervated, these potent images were a sign of renewed vitality.

More than lackadaisical about his career, he was totally indifferent. Bacon had never had any formal art training, and even when he began to teach himself to paint during the 30's it seems to have been little more than a distraction from drinking, gambling and wandering around the edges of London society. ''Bacon before 1939,'' writes John Russell in his monograph on the artist, was ''Marginal Man personified.'' When the Second World War began, he tried to enlist but was turned down because of his asthma.

Yet the years spent in Dublin, Berlin and Paris, and in London during some of its grimmest days, clearly left their mark. The emotional turbulence of Bacon's life, the restlessness, the sexual indiscretions, the sense of frustration and claustrophobia he felt as a boy, the offhand disregard for social mores and, importantly, the complete lack of concern for what others might think - all these became distinguishing features of his art. Only toward the end of the war, when he was already 35 years old and just beginning to take himself seriously, did Bacon finally realize that painting was the best way for him to bring order to the chaos of his life, to translate what he calls his ''obsessions'' into concrete images.",UNNERVING ART,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/magazine/unnerving-art.html

He quickly becomes lost, asks directions from a guard, takes another wrong turn and again loses his way. The circuitous route leads him past some pottery, a display of raincoats, medieval wood carvings and jewelry, and in every case the artist becomes momentarily absorbed by what he sees. Just as he feels socially at ease with both petty thieves and wealthy patrons, he can become deeply intrigued by a Turner hanging in the National Gallery and also by a chair he glimpses in the window of Conran's on his way to lunch. Not surprisingly, Bacon's paintings are full of references to Ingres and the daily press, to Picasso -who, with Duchamp, remains just about the only 20th-century artist he admires - and the latest fashion shows.",UNNERVING ART,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/magazine/unnerving-art.html

Although Bacon spent a good portion of his youth in the Irish countryside, he has painted very few landscapes. Yet he feels a particular affinity with these scenes and with many of the small sketches displayed in cases nearby because, he explains, they exemplify Constable's ''free style, his tremendous spontaneity.''",UNNERVING ART,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/magazine/unnerving-art.html

Sometimes he will toss a bucket of paint across the canvas in order to promote spontaneity. ''I have to hope that my instincts will do the right thing,'' Bacon says, ''because I can't erase what I have done. And if I drew something first, then my paintings would be illustrations of drawings.'' Arriving at another of his favorite phrases, he adds, ''I want to create images that are a shorthand of sensation.'' Photographs have always been a source of inspiration for Bacon.

During the 50's, he combined references to Velazquez's ''Portrait of Pope Innocent X'' and a still photograph of a screaming nurse from Sergei Eisenstein's film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' to create his series of screaming popes, which have achieved a degree of fame he now finds tedious. ''Those references were just mental starting points, armatures on which to hang the pictures,'' Bacon says. ''Actually, I hate those popes.

He compares them to police mug shots of a suspect's face and profiles. Nonetheless, his paintings often contain arrows, circles, mirrors and boxes that seem to single out one or two elements as having special significance. Bacon disagrees. ''I've no story to tell,'' he says. IT IS EARLY AFTERNOON, and so far Bacon has had nothing to drink. Once, when asked to sum up his life, he said it consisted of ''going from bar to bar and drinking and that kind of thing.'' The walk is short from the museum to Bibendum, the elegant restaurant in a former Michelin tire factory where Bacon has made a lunch reservation and where he is greeted warmly as a regular. He orders oysters and the first of what will be many glasses of champagne. By the end of the meal he has also drunk the better part of two bottles of wine.

Parts of his limbs and chest are invariably missing, as if they had evaporated. In all the scenes Dyer is alone and in the sort of bare, windowless room that is a trademark of Bacon's work but in this case specifically evokes the hotel in Paris. The flesh is both roseate and ashen -voluptuous and deathly -and in several of the scenes Dyer casts a pink shadow that does not conform precisely to the shape of his body but resembles a thick pool of liquid or a spectral presence, like a shadowy version of the beastly Furies Bacon later painted in a triptych based on the ''Oresteia.''",UNNERVING ART,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/magazine/unnerving-art.html

Paul Bowles, for whom travel was like a neurosis, seemed to pursue none of these. As far as one can tell, he traveled simply to get away. Compared with writers like Lawrence Durrell, Norman Lewis, Robert Byron or Patrick Leigh Fermor, he is an incurious traveler. He loves awfulness, or offalness. One is never very far from the smell of excrement in his travel writing and his fiction.",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

The only reason one can imagine for going to some of the places they choose is that they need to know the worst. Travel becomes an infinite regression, an undoing of everything from toilet training to high culture. Sometimes the characters are killed by the impact of so much otherness, so that travel becomes an indirect form of suicide.",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

He was the patron saint of the Beats, a writer who, like an American Beckett, discovered alienation for us. Years ago Franklin P. Adams said of Jack Kerouac that no one could describe a man eating a plate of beans better than he could. One might say of Paul Bowles that no one could describe better than he does the peculiar odor, mood or ambiguous menace of a North African town. While other writers have done a more convincing job of depicting Americans floundering in a foreign place, Mr. Bowles's people have an almost camp quality that moves us in a primitive or unreasonable way, as dreams do. Certainly he is the grand panjandrum of paranoid expatriation, an almost perfect example in his life and work of a familiar American syndrome. Also, he is something of a bore, which raises interesting questions about the relation between boredom and modern art.",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

The theme of alienation seems to attract the admiration of the earnest and the awkward. All we know of Mr. Sawyer-Laucanno is that he teaches in the foreign languages and literatures section at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that he has done translations and has written books as a staff writer for Time-Life Books in Japan. It is at least partly true that the quality of a writer's biographer is, in some convoluted ironic sense, the sincerest criticism of him and his work. Still, though Mr. Sawyer-Laucanno can't write a decent colloquial sentence, he has done quite a decent job of presenting Mr. Bowles.

According to a family legend that Mr. Bowles says he believes, his father, who did not want a child, took him from his crib during a snowstorm, stripped him and put him on the sill of an open window. The young Paul was forbidden to play with other children, the perfect prescription for raising a modern writer. At the family table he was forced to Fletcherize his food, a contemporary health fad that required him to chew each mouthful at least 40 times before swallowing. It is not surprising that when he became a writer, Mr. Bowles was one of our first minimalists. At the age of 9 he wrote an ''opera'' about wife swapping, divorce, drugs, desertion, lawsuits and plague. For the next 10 years he appears to have been merely a pretentious, not very talented young man who ran away to Paris when he was 18, fully expecting, he said, never to see his parents again.",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

The book, however, was so noncommittal that William Burroughs, who knew Mr. Bowles, called it ''Without Telling.'' Virgil Thomson, another friend, said it read like a travelogue rather than a life. The book left almost everything about Mr. Bowles ambiguous. Though he was married, it was impossible to tell which sex, if any, he preferred. There was no hint of what sort of reasons he gave himself for his incessant travels.

With very little formal training, he became a highly regarded, if not profound, composer, and while only half-educated, he produced a first novel, called ''The Sheltering Sky,'' that was a literary best seller. His books have been praised at one time or another by almost everybody, and one is tempted to say he somehow usurped the roles of writer and composer.

If there are marriages made in heaven, this one was apparently made in hell. She was entirely lesbian and he was, according to his friends, uninterested - or ''disinterested,'' as Mr. Sawyer-Laucanno would say - in sex. They may have married because they found the incongruity irresistible. Once they were husband and wife, Jane was promiscuous and Paul was abstemious. He admits to only two sexual consummations, both in Paris - one hetero- and one homosexual - and says he was disgusted by both. Most of his close friends were homosexual, but he appears to have been merely a nonparticipating fellow traveler. You might say that he traveled in everything. It is possible too that this lack of sexual definition undermined the characters in his books, that it deprived them of a certain kind of recognizability.",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

Besides drinking too much, she enslaved herself to a rapacious and illiterate North African woman who appropriated most of her property and some of her sanity. While all this was going on year after year, in one country after another, Mr. Bowles behaved with an inscrutable patience and forbearance. Their marriage was so open that it yawned. While Jane hoped to be ''a source of mild pleasure at meal times,'' Paul never said what he hoped to be for her. Sometimes with Jane and sometimes without her, he lived in a remote town in the Sahara, a tiny island off Ceylon, in Morocco and in Mexico.

It is about a French professor of linguistics who goes to North Africa to study a particular dialect and is kidnapped by nomads who cut out his tongue, tie tin cans to him and turn him into a dancing clown. The story realized the worst fears of the contemporary imagination: to be disarticulated, to be an object of ridicule, to be used and to be homeless. In Mr. Sawyer-Laucanno's all-too-imitable summing up, ''A Distant Episode'' is ''as precise, cold, and delicate as cut crystal.''",THE MAN WHO DISCOVERED ALIENATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/the-man-who-discovered-alienation.html

''Unhappiness,'' he said, ''should be studied very carefully; this is certainly no time for anyone to pretend to be happy.'' Yet in ''An Invisible Spectator'' he does not come across as particularly unhappy.

The couple are at an impasse in their sexual relations, and she sleeps with the friend while the husband chooses an Arab prostitute.

It was described in The New Yorker as ''a dull story . . . about an unamiable couple who are incessant nap-takers.''

In an age of improbabilities, Jane and Paul Bowles's marriage was one of the imaginative prodigies of that institution, a tragedy so perfectly of its time that it achieves an almost classical status.

Moreover, when a pregnant woman takes a drug and gets a rush, the fetus gets the drug through the placenta. Because he cannot recirculate the drug back to the mother, it gets caught in his system and he may get 10 or more rushes each time. The drug is carried in the blood, raising the blood pressure and cutting down the circulation to the brain and other areas, thus increasing the possibility of birth abnormalities.","From Drug Babies, a Cry for Help",https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-from-drug-babies-a-cry-for-help.html

Far up the Maine coast from the fabled seaside resorts of Kennebunkport and Bar Harbor, it's a place where most folks just barely scrape by on seasonal work. Even their kitchen gardens are unyielding, full of stones ''as though something is sending them up from deep inside the earth, or that they have to come to the surface to breathe, like seals or cormorants.'' Named for a fisherman and smuggler called Monkey, who was murdered at a nearby bay, the town is an isolated backwater of rusting house trailers, boarded-up bait shops and rundown laundromats, not to mention the dreary bottle-redemption and video-rental center where tall, once pretty Marilla Pratt is employed.",FAR FROM KENNEBUNKPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/far-from-kennebunkport.html

It's a decision she's beginning to regret. About all that can be said for Tucker, who spends most of his time holed up in the cellar germinating marijuana seeds and contemplating the end of the world, is that he has a quirky, feline independence. Marilla can be terrifically stubborn in her own way - she more than half suspects she married Lyle mainly to disprove her mother's prediction that she'd never land a husband - and she doesn't waste much time repining over her circumstances. But when her ''set-adrift daughter'' returns home after a three-year sojourn out West, confused and full of resentment for both her parents, all hell threatens to break loose.",FAR FROM KENNEBUNKPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/books/far-from-kennebunkport.html

His trumpet work on ''West End Blues,'' recorded in the late 1920's, is positively stunning. A born showman, he pushed on to Hollywood in the 1930's, appearing in everything from silly jungle romps to a string of Bing Crosby movies. No matter how racially offensive the production numbers, it's noted, Armstrong's talent and personality always emerged unscathed.

Recalling that Armstrong was arrested in Hollywood in 1930 on a marijuana charge, the documentary notes that Armstrong would continue to smoke it - 6 to 10 joints a day - all his life. We are also reminded that Armstrong's final years were marked by unfortunate tensions. For one thing, with the advent of modern jazz typified by Parker and the others, Armstrong was sometimes dismissed as old-fashioned. For another, during the volatile civil-rights eruptions of the 1960's he was condemned by some activists as an ''Uncle Tom'' even as, incredibly enough, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating him for possible Communist leanings.

Frank Deford, a former senior staff writer for Sports Illustrated and a television sports analyst, is also a novelist, mystery writer, biographer and the author of several nonfiction books. Now he has written the essential what-if book of baseball, ''Casey on the Loose.'' In Ernest L. Thayer's oft-recited 100-year-old poem, ''Casey at the Bat,'' the mighty Casey did not come through for the beloved Mudville team. In the bottom of the ninth inning with two out, two men on, the score at 4-2 and two called strikes against him, Casey whiffed. Now, Mr. Deford asks, what if the catcher let the third strike get by him? Intrigued? Of course. So read the book - a novella, actually - and find out about what happened to Casey after he got extraordinarily lucky, and about the story of Casey's complicated life before the notorious game. And learn about the origin of the seventh-inning stretch, how the spitball came into play and what team was beaten by Mudville. ''Casey on the Loose'' also features photographs of the characters to whom Mr. Deford has given new life, as well as those of his own invention: Casey himself, his girlfriend, his mentors and fellow ''ballists,'' in addition to an assortment of cranks, wheeler-dealers and scribes. Any time a writer has this much fun producing a book, you can bet the reader will reap the rewards. Go reap.","IN SHORT;

Fresh means the beer is on tap as soon as the fermenting process is completed. Natural means no fillers like rice, corn and sugar and no chemical preservatives. Brewpubs boast that their beers contain only the elements prescribed by Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria in the 16th century when he enacted a purity of beer law, known in the trade as Reinheitsgebot - malted grains such as barley as well as water and hops - plus yeast.

This time, her fiance is a middle-aged friend of her father's - a kind, self-deprecating man named Louis, who seems to elicit in Annie a feeling of security, rather than passion. She is worried about the effect of the union on her father and Linda, and she is equally concerned about how her ex-husband, Cole, will react to the news of her remarriage. Indeed, Cole soon comes to see himself as the victim of a predicament similar to that experienced earlier by Mr. Field: he feels he has been wrongly deprived of his daughter, and he vows to get her back - a decision that will set off a series of increasingly brutal confrontations.","Books of The Times; Fathers, Daughters and the Terrors of Love",https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/05/books/books-of-the-times-fathers-daughters-and-the-terrors-of-love.html

He shows us the selfishness of love, and he shows us how anger, pity and resentment are factored into the equation of familial emotions: how Annie can rage against her father's strictures and yet marry a man much like him; how she can fear for her ungainly daughter's happiness and yet revile her for slovenliness and poor hygiene; how her father can yearn to make her happy and yet rejoice in the collapse of her marriage. As Annie says to her fiance, Louis: ''When I think of all the things he did because he loved me - what people visit on each other out of something like love. It's enough for all the world's woe, Louis. You don't even need hate to have a perfectly miserable time.''","Books of The Times; Fathers, Daughters and the Terrors of Love",https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/05/books/books-of-the-times-fathers-daughters-and-the-terrors-of-love.html

In fact, even the more extreme reactions of the characters in this novel are made to seem plausible and real, and as Cole embarks on his quest to reclaim Annie and Linda, the reader feels a net of inevitability tighten around them all. Having created an entire network of relationships and emotional connections, Mr. Bausch simply allows fate, as embodied in each individual's character, to do its work - with predictably devastating results.","Books of The Times; Fathers, Daughters and the Terrors of Love",https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/05/books/books-of-the-times-fathers-daughters-and-the-terrors-of-love.html

For all that, though, when he saw the size of the man, when he factored in his complexion and considered the oddness of the circumstances, he felt uncertain of himself.

But in March 1982, Mr. Gugliotta and Mr. Leen write, agents of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration stumbled upon nearly two tons of pure cocaine hidden in a cargo of blue jeans imported to Florida from Colombia.

In ''Kings of Cocaine,'' the stories are muted of most of this irony. One case involved a confessed American drug smuggler, Barry Seal, who aided Federal prosecutors in their case against the Medellin barons. Mr. Seal ultimately testified in three major trials that brought 17 convictions. His effectiveness was ended by the Administration, though, when Lieut. Col. Oliver North was briefed on Mr. Seal's contention that the cartel had begun operating in Sandinista Nicaragua. The Drug Enforcement Administration had planned with Mr. Seal to capture the kingpins Mr. Escobar and Mr. Ochoa in Mexico, but it was forced to dump the plan when Colonel North, concerned about influencing a key Congressional vote on aid to the contras, leaked ''the Sandinista connection.'' (The Drug Enforcement Administration later said it had no independent evidence of Sandinista complicity.) The war continued, with more appalling bloodshed in Colombia as President Virgilio Barco Vargas succeeded Mr. Betancur. His feeble antidrug efforts were answered with the assassinations of the head of the Narcotics Bureau, Col. Jaime Ramirez Gomez, the crusading newspaper editor Guillermo Cano Isaza and Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos Jiminez. The one effective weapon available to the Colombian President, one hardly employed by Mr. Betancur, was the 1981 American extradition treaty. Finally it was used against a cartel member - Mr. Lehder - in February 1987 when he was arrested in a remote area of Colombia. Quickly packed off to the United States before the cartel could mass its army of attorneys or even murder another justice official, Mr. Lehder was tried in Tampa, Fla., for smuggling, conspiracy and tax evasion and found guilty on all counts; he was sentenced to life without parole plus 135 years. Testimony at his trial was used, moreover, in the Federal indictments of his fellow drug barons this year. Whether they will be brought to justice or evade it as they have for nearly 20 years remains to be seen.",BAD THINGS CAME IN SMALL PLANES,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/30/books/bad-things-came-in-small-planes.html

For his new title, Mr. Zindel reached out to a book by Joseph Campbell, the late, charismatic scholar of mythology. Chris's stories, like most folk tales, are his amulets against the demons of everyday life, a form of temporary salvation until he can find a real way to save himself.","THEATER;

An approach that works is changing that automatic habit of reaching for a cigarette by making life-style changes. With each quit attempt, you learn more and more, which is why subsequent quit attempts are more likely to be successful. Some people keep a diary and see that they smoke after their morning cup of coffee, or when in the car. They can rearrange their day, so they're not having their breakfast in the same place; they have it perhaps at their office where they can't smoke.

That's true with some smokers. But with a smoker, it's not uncommon to have multiple attempts to quit. The more attempts the smoker makes, the more likelihood he will succeed. If he keeps on falling back on smoking, this does not mean that he is a failure. He has to keep trying and he will be able to do it. That's indicated through research. A lot of people think that if they have a cigarette they are failures and don't want to try again. But there is a difference between a slip and a relapse. Having one cigarette does not mean a person is a smoker again. He has to say, ''I am a nonsmoker but I had that one cigarette, but I'm still a nonsmoker.'' Similarly with dieting, ''I'm a dieter and just because I had an ice cream sundae doesn't mean I'm not a dieter.'' ","Westchester Q&A;: Karen J. Fersht;

It's something very ingrained; it doesn't go away. Like biting your nail. I used to do that. If I feel under a lot of stress, all of a sudden I find myself biting my nails. It's an immediate, unconscious reaction. The single most effective technique for stopping smoking is to replace the habit with something positive, like an exercise program, not with more eating.

They are really the target of the tobacco industry. The decline of smoking is lower among women than men. It's worth noting that more women now die of lung cancer than breast cancer. A lot of the tobacco industry targets women with brands such as Virginia Slims showing slim, attractive women smoking. I remember when I did a smoking cessation clinic I'd say to a man, ''You don't have to quit smoking, but you have to smoke Virginia Slims'' and they wouldn't do it. ","Westchester Q&A;: Karen J.

After analyzing a number of them, Costa published an essay last year called ''Narcissism in a Dark Age,'' which is the talk of Rio. Its thesis is that without ideas that give hope, with no cultural referents to give direction to one's life or to protect one from existential anguish, the human being becomes like an animal; when a man's confidence in his culture is ruptured and he loses faith in the future, he falls into a state of ''narcissistic panic'' in which because nothing matters anymore he is capable of doing anything.",RIO IS THE CARNIVAL OVER?,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/magazine/rio-is-the-carnival-over.html

In ''A Prayer for Owen Meany'' John Irving makes it all too plain, and with positive rage, that in his eyes American society has been a moral disaster since the 1960's. He instances the America that snickered at President Kennedy's amours in the White House, the Vietnam War that sacrificed more than 58,000 of our young men, the moralizing and piety of national leaders who refuse to hinder the traffic in weapons of every kind, to say nothing of a widespread appetite for drugs and the ''junk food'' of television, which ''gives good disaster.''",Article 623189 -- No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/books/article-623189-no-title.html

Although he had half of his right forefinger amputated by Owen Meany so he could stay out of the Vietnam War (more about this later), out of disgust with his native land he emigrated to Toronto, where he teaches English literature in an Anglican academy for young ladies. (He has abandoned his ancestral Congregationalism for the Episcopal Church in America, the Anglican Church in Canada, and his constant companion is the Book of Common Prayer.) The book is as discursive as an undergraduate bull session, and the plot, simplicity itself, raises as many questions as stories of miracles usually do. Owen Meany, the little saint (the scene in which he is left hanging on a coat hook also suggests a ''Christ figure''), is unrecognized by all in the school town except his straight man and adoring disciple, the narrator John Wheelwright. Strange occurrences: Owen ''accidentally'' kills the narrator's mother (more about this later), and not only feels no guilt but manages to persuade the son that it was all foreseen (which means desired) by God. Since the narrator is illegitimate, her death seems necessary to our comprehending the inner perfection of a woman outwardly ''immoral.'' Strange occurrences: Owen foresees the exact day of his death as a martyr. His ''inside'' knowledge convinces him that he is God's messenger. Because he is so odd-looking and odd-sounding, he acts out the necessary paradox on earth suitable to men altogether holy within, though he can drink beer to excess and sleeps with the one girl in town unconventional enough to appreciate his stern disapproval of contemporary goings-on.

Does she have to die in order to make the point that there is a mystery to this our life that we have to accept if we are to believe in a providence? This may be true in general, but here in New Hampshire the point is so forced that it is repellent. And does Owen Meany ever believe, because his parents (in some confusion) told him, that his was a virgin birth? Is it really a proof of spiritual powers that Owen Meany, while acting in a school production of ''A Christmas Carol,'' should see on the stage tombstone the exact date not only of Scrooge's death but of his own? Does the corpse of a pet armadillo have to be deprived of its claws, as the Indian founder of the town is pictured without arms, in order to make the point that the world is besotted with weapons?

John Wheelwright and Owen Meany love each other almost as much as John Irving loves them, the ''good'' characters, to the death. Clearly, Mr. Irving has come to such a point in his revulsion from our disorder that he has decided (this is hardly novel in ''religious'' fiction) that the true saints and even ''Christ figures'' are the oddballs, and that only such can do anything about this gashed, violent, yet morally torpid society.

The French and German offices will issue tickets for Eastern Europe, but do not make reservations or book sleeping accommodations for journeys starting there. For Western Europe, the four offices point out that reserving seats is scarcely necessary because of the frequency of trains, generally ample space and computerized reservations systems. (Reservations are necessary for sleepers.) They say travelers might just as well make reservations on the spot. Indeed, in Switzerland for many years passengers could not make seat reservations, although recently the system introduced them on some inter-city lines. BritRail has an office in New York but, aside from its own network, it makes books journeys across the Channel to only a few places, including Channel ports and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
