In 1995 inmates at an I.N.S. detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., rioted over beatings and the use of shackles. The I.N.S. later criticized the private company that administered the center, Esmor, for ''inhumane'' conditions. Conditions in local jails are often far worse, and the I.N.S. cannot supervise them. Human Rights Watch has collected numerous allegations of beatings and other mistreatment. The I.N.S. has called for a government investigation of alleged torture of immigrants by electric shock in a Florida jail. Immigrants often have no access to lawyers or even someone who speaks their language. Worst off are the 1,800 people scheduled for deportations to countries that will not take them back, such as Cuba.

The I.N.S. is beginning to study how to get people to keep their court appointments without locking them up. One pilot project run by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group, keeps immigrants who seem unlikely to flee out of jail if they check in regularly and receive home visits from supervisors.

The 5,000 children detained each year should be put in group homes or foster care, not juvenile jails. Some people will require detention, but it should be in centers for immigrants. Congress should allow the I.N.S. to build its own facilities, which must be strictly supervised. Above all, the I.N.S. and Congress must abandon their punitive mentality.

In one study that compared marijuana to Marinol -- the active ingredient in the marijuana plant -- patients preferred Marinol. It is premature to refer to medicinal marijuana.

As with other medicine, the distinction between abuse and legitimate use is clear. In addition, legitimate medical use of marijuana has been supported by The New England Journal of Medicine. Medical marijuana controls nausea for cancer and AIDS patients, reduces spasms for paraplegia and neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and controls eye pressure for glaucoma patients. Among test patients in the Federal Investigational New Drug program, which dispenses medical marijuana, there have been no cases of abuse, and some patients have been receiving marijuana for two decades. In terms of the broader social ramifications, California is our best case study.

Gray describes a golden age of drug use prior to the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, when ''the country had looked upon addicts as unfortunate citizens with a medical problem.''

That crime reduction held first place among Nixon's priorities -- not the care of addicts -- is illustrated by the Administration's surprising willingness to adopt methadone, a synthetic opiate, as its preferred treatment for heroin users. At the time, a high-ranking official in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs told me that the bureau would hand out heroin if it thought that would cut crime.

Heroin use was skyrocketing; crime was rampant. In his 1968 campaign Nixon had declared that ''D. C. should not stand for disorder and crime.'' Washington became the laboratory for national drug policies. In 1970 DuPont, with support from the White House, established the Narcotics Treatment Administration, which was soon flooded with applicants. Although nondrug treatment was also offered, methadone appeared to cut the crime rate quickly, and that impressed the President and his aides.

The 1970's witnessed the climax of a long-simmering reaction against law enforcement as the chief tool against drug abuse. That era of toleration, however, peaked about 1980, and since then we have been on a slope leading toward intolerance of drug use. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's attack on methadone maintenance is a recent example of opposition to any drug use by former users. As valuable as methadone may be for some (and I believe it can be helpful), it is an uphill battle to justify it to those who have zero tolerance for drugs.

He attributes to himself the most sincere and best of motives.

In other paintings, she writes, ''boys never become men, they become skeletons and skulls. . . . Basquiat is obsessed with deconstructing the images and language of his fragmented world.'' Basquiat secretly hid some of his best work so it could not be sold.

He was a master of hype and buying art in bulk, and organized shows for Basquiat in Tokyo, Paris and Madrid. (Today, he owns the best collection of Basquiat.) Bischofberger persuaded Warhol to work with Basquiat. Warhol was inspired by Basquiat's energy and youth. Basquiat idolized Warhol -- the artist who more than any other seemed to embody contemporary culture. He desperately needed and wanted Warhol's approval. The two became inseparable, working and partying together for months. Warhol never took drugs; he was appalled and fascinated by Basquiat's excesses.",Hyped to Death,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/09/books/hyped-to-death.html

By placing the document in the context of 90 previous declarations issued throughout the Colonies, the author ''offers Americans a fresh perspective on their most treasured national relic,'' Richard Alan Ryerson wrote here last year. Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution, by Benson Bobrick (Penguin, $15.95), reminds readers that the Revolutionary War was full of amazing stories and characters -- led by a heaven-sent hero (George Washington) and a world-class villain (Benedict Arnold). Bobrick ''has studied his subject deeply and writes about it with real understanding and verve,'' Frederick Allen said in these pages in 1997. In The Long Affair: Thomas Jefferson and the French Revolution, 1785-1800, by Conor Cruise O'Brien (University of Chicago, $15), an Irish author locates a strain of visionary violence in Jefferson's near-religious defense of the Revolution.

And of course, there are special-education classes, frequently a dumping ground for emotionally uncentered teen-agers. So, at a cost of $17 million, Honda built Eagle Rock, a resortlike campus that in addition to six housing units includes a gym, complete with basketball court, weight room and swimming pool; a full-length soccer field; three classroom buildings; a main office, and the all-purpose lodge, where the kids eat, watch TV and attend the morning gatherings.

Nonetheless, with applications on the rise, the school has become more discriminating in whom it admits, seeking teen-agers who are making some effort toward reclaiming their lives. (One school official suggested that under these new guidelines, Jerry might not have been admitted; moreover, the school prefers admitting younger teen-agers, usually 15- or 16-year-olds.) But the school has become most concerned about those who are forced out because of bad behavior, and so has begun to consider alternatives to expulsion. Ten students who had committed nonnegotiables, including Willow and Danielle, spent this past January camped along a ridge that bounds the property to the east. Each student was given three sheets of plywood and a tarp to build a sleeping structure; they smartly chose to pool their resources and construct one large shelter.

A former Director of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology (1968-1995), Dr. Morishima was an early leader in the field of genetics and did innovative work with his mentor, Melvin Grumbach, MD, in describing normal characteristics as well as disorders of the X chromosome. He also was involved in collaborative studies on the mutagenic properties of marijuana and other recreational drugs. Most recently, and most importantly, Dr. Morishima, through his insights from work with patients, elucidated in a very exciting way the role estrogen plays in bone growth and bone calcification and in normal pituitary-gonadal interactions in both sexes. Dr. Morishima maintained professional ties with Japan as a visiting professor and keynote speaker at professional meetings and was active in the Japanese-American communities in New York and New Jersey. In recognition of these activities, in 1975 he received the prestigious ''Presentation of a Favour'' from the Emperor and Empress of Japan. Dr. Morishima was an enthusiastic teacher and generous colleague.

Mangan, reported on a study in which he asked people in different age groups to estimate when three minutes had passed by silently counting one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand and so on. People in their early 20's were accurate within three seconds, and some got it exactly right. People in their 60's estimated that three minutes were up after 3 minutes and 40 seconds had passed.

In brain imaging experiments by Dr. Sean Hinton at Duke, people were asked to estimate when 11 seconds were up and to squeeze a ball just before and after this interval.

The issue before them: whether the state should add a provision to Louisiana's drinking law that would prohibit 18- to 20-year-olds from entering bars. The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways. In 1995, Louisiana had 883 traffic fatalities, of which slightly more than half were alcohol-related -- the third highest rate in the country.",Strong Stuff,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/22/magazine/strong-stuff.html

Convinced that the best way to promote the wholesalers' interests was to elect a pro-business Congress, Rehr bestowed most of that money on Republicans.

When the Drug Enforcement Administration blocked Florida as the prime highway for cocaine, the Colombian cartels responded by expanding their partnership with some of their old friends in Mexico, who offered not only a network already established through their traditional traffic in heroin and marijuana, but a long and vulnerable land border with the United States. The Mexican drug barons began receiving payment in cocaine instead of cash, and the Colombians were forced to cede sales turf in Texas, along the East Coast and especially in California itself. ''Soon the Mexican mafias were supplying 70 percent of the cocaine consumed yearly in the United States,'' Rotella writes, ''were earning between $10 billion and $30 billion a year in profits and, according to a study by the University of Guadalajara, were spending $500 million a year exclusively on the bribery of public officials in Mexico. That figure was roughly double the entire budget of the Mexican federal attorney general's office and federal police.''",Nice Guys Finish Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/books/nice-guys-finish-dead.html

An assassin had killed the presidential candidate, whose own campaign guards were suspected in the assassination. The federal police, in league with drug lords, were suspected of killing the city police chief.

Nice guys finish not last, but dead. Rotella, the Los Angeles Times bureau chief for Latin America, reprises in detail two of the more famous cases, the assassination of presidential front-runner Luis Donaldo Colosio in March 1994, and the surreal and furious firefight that left a Roman Catholic cardinal bleeding his life away at the Guadalajara airport in May 1993, a crime for which a group of San Diego homeboys, in way over their heads, became the fall guys. The leader of that group, David Barron Corona -- a trusted associate of Ramon Arellano Felix, one of two brothers who control the Tijuana cartel, whose life he saved in a gunfight in a Puerto Vallarta disco -- was killed only a few weeks ago, not by the the strong arm of justice but accidentally by one of his own crew during an attempted hit on a Tijuana journalist. This is a world that uncannily resembles an American gangster movie because, to some extent, it imitates one. Al Pacino's white-suited Tony Montana, the hero of Oliver Stone's remake of ''Scarface,'' is a role model to many of these guys, a poster on the bedroom wall, an icon along with others that Rotella lists here: the AK-47, the Harley-Davidson and the Virgin of Guadalupe (the patron saint of Mexico, but so popular in California, the joke goes, that they've given her a green card).",Nice Guys Finish Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/books/nice-guys-finish-dead.html

It would be Monty Python were it not so tragic. Gutierrez returns home one night with his wife and daughter, and his investigations are brought to an abrupt and familiar close: ''There were four of them; apparently they were ordered to physically destroy their victim, not just to murder him. They fired more than 120 rounds with automatic rifles.

Caught smoking marijuana in his dorm room, Thomas Emmendorfer, known as Underdog, is expelled from Jasper College; at loose ends, he rents a room in an off-campus boardinghouse and finds a job at the college print shop. He also finds romance with two fellow townies, Judy Baine, an earthy landscaper and the daughter of his landlady, and Ione Twayblade, the alluring but troubled (and troublesome) cashier at the college credit union. Underdog competes for the affections of the latter with William (Race) Fletcher, whose book on the sitcom ''Green Acres'' (''Deconstruction Acres: Imploding the Myth of Rural Simplicity'') has won him wealth, some fame and a prestigious academic appointment.

The kid was in jeopardy because the assorted groups that make up the Olympic hierarchy have no uniform policy on marijuana. The snowboarders, those strange nonconformists who somehow all look and sound alike, have a marijuana policy of don't ask, don't tell. They were forced to enter these Winter Games under the mantle of the world skiing federation, which permits a minimal limit of 15 nanograms of marijuana per milliliter. The kid chipped in with a horrifying 17.8 nanograms. The International Olympic Committee has no limit, but it is vaguely against marijuana. This leaves a lot of room for mischief, much of it perpetrated on Ross Rebagliati. Carol Anne Letheren, the chief executive officer of the Canadian Olympic Association, said she was told by drug authorities back in Canada that ''if you smoked a joint,'' the measurement would be 400 nanograms. And if you were ''in a room with eight to 10 people for one hour a day for six days,'' the reading would be 100 nanograms. Rebagliati said he hadn't smoked a joint since April 1997 and the Canadian association saw no reason to challenge him. According to Letheren, marijuana is not considered a performance-enhancing drug for a sport like snowboarding, which consists of strapping both feet to one curved board and performing tricks that nobody in his right mind would attempt. Letheren also informed us that marijuana would be considered performance-enhancing if used to alleviate fear by somebody like Eddie the Eagle, the fabulously incompetent British ski jumper. Did this mean that Eddie the Eagle had been zonked while botching his jumps in past Winter Games?

Diana Atkinson's first novel, ''Highways and Dancehalls,'' is told as the journal of Sarah's first year on the road, dancing in western Canada's motels and bars. Sarah writes whenever she can, setting down stark observations that illuminate her life like a strobe light. In this intimate form, her portraits of the other dancers are also strikingly effective. Whether they're backstage sewing sequins on their costumes, getting high on cocaine mixed with marijuana or curling up together on the bus, these strippers are all too real. But the egghead aspect of Sarah's character is more scrambled. Frequent flashbacks give us glimpses of her childhood, marked by a near-fatal illness, but her troubled family history remains murky. Her feelings of resentment toward her mother are palpable but unexplained, and her sister, who suffered from the same illness Sarah did, is not mentioned until the final pages of the book. While Atkinson never tells us which half of Sarah she thinks is the better one, in the end the professor's daughter is frustratingly unrealized -- utterly outstripped by her roadhouse counterpart. ''Everybody has to fall for something,'' Sarah comments at the close, and readers, though left in the dark by her scattered forays off stage, may well fall for the exquisitely abject world of the strippers she has brought so unsettlingly to life.
