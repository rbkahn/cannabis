Its rank-and-file officers, wedded to traditions that date from the middle of the last century, resist new ideas. What is more, the new policing demands a special breed of officer, tough but skilled, and smart -- an organizer, a planner, an ombudsman.

In New York there's no reward for walking a beat; no detective's gold shield, no sergeant's stripes, no cash bonus. The path to promotion and a raise is still through the special units -- narcotics, vice, organized crime. And Kevin Jett must move up: to support his three children he supplements his base pay of $3,100 a month with his earnings in a supermarket as a part-time fishmonger. By all standards, his own and those of his superiors, Kevin Jett has succeeded. Crime statistics in his monthly community policing log show that when he was off the beat for any substantial period, there were more burglaries, robberies, car thefts. His sources on the street have told him that when he's sick, injured or on leave, drugs sales go up, too. He attributes his success to his size, strength and background: a black belt in karate, a Bronxite wise in the ways of the streets. ""Not every cop can work single patrol,"" he says. ""I grew up in the city. I faced everything the knuckleheads faced."" The advocates of community policing, however, would argue that even a less streetwise cop, one from East Cupcake, could have assumed ownership of Beat 12. It might have taken more time, but a smart, determined cop armed with the penal code can, they say, ""establish a presence"" anywhere.","One Cop, Eight Square Blocks",https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/magazine/one-cop-eight-square-blocks.html

Yet officials are reluctant to ascribe the trend to any one factor, or even to recognize the existence of a trend based on such notoriously unreliable statistics.

She was one of the smart kids, an honor student and a civil rights activist who wore black turtlenecks and hung out in Greenwich Village cafes. She also smoked a little grass. When she went off to Vassar with a scholarship, she stuffed bags of marijuana in her guitar case, hoping to sell them. Vassar wasn't quite ready for dope in 1961, so Ms. Lydon smoked by herself. Then a friend introduced her to diet pills, and by junior year she knew she had a problem.

She married a budding journalist named Michael Lydon, and they landed in San Francisco just in time for the late 60's. She worked for Ramparts and the Lydons helped Jann Wenner start Rolling Stone. She participated in one of the first women's consciousness-raising groups, wrote the influential feminist essay ""The Politics of Orgasm"" for Ramparts, got a book contract and contributed freelance articles to The New York Times. She also had a baby, broke up with her husband and had lots of affairs. It was a fairly typical Bay Area coming of age, conducted largely in a chemical haze. Later she and her daughter moved to New York and Ms. Lydon continued writing, but eventually the drugs made it impossible for her to work except as a night proofreader.

Now, looking back on the years of her addiction, Ms. Lydon can see the illusions that floated in the atmosphere, can recognize the difference between the Summer of Love and the disaster at Altamont. To a certain extent she can also analyze her own deadly attraction to junkie hell. ""Street life is seductive,"" she writes.

Mr. Katz's version of her story lacks a great deal of the personal detail that she supplies, especially about junkie life and the recovery process, but his book fills in an enormous amount of family background that Ms. Lydon skimps on, perhaps because it had already been recorded there. Mr. Katz is also able to describe Ms. Lydon as her family saw her -- a perspective that adds considerably to the presentation of self she offers in her own book. It's too bad for an author to have her story published before she can tell it herself, but the peculiar truth is that Ms. Lydon's book doesn't do justice to her extraordinary life.

""About 10 days before the fight, tickets weren't selling, and I told Don King, 'There's something wrong, and if we don't fix it, I'm gone.'

By the time The Post approached her about joining its revamped Sunday magazine in 1986, both she and her teen-age daughter had tired of their somewhat bohemian existence.

In 1966 I was 19 years old, married and already a mother, still living in Utah, the place where I had spent my whole life. For me, the 1960's might as well not have been happening. I was square, barely there, a teen-age bride stuck in the Jell-O belt. Everything around me was rather luridly normal. Drugs still meant aspirin or antibiotics, and to question authority meant asking the local bishop for advice. Then I left Utah abruptly and within weeks found myself living on the campus of a small liberal arts college in Minnesota. Suddenly I had not only left behind a provincial life, but I had entered the 60's full-blown. Each day I found myself surrounded by students whose lives were being transformed by a new sense of sexual freedom, whose need to consume potent mind-altering agents on a daily basis seemed to rescue them from the dread experience of ordinary consciousness.",The Day the 60's Died,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/books/the-day-the-60s-died.html

Rarely has the impact of that era been more closely examined in fiction with such even, successful results. Yet Abel Richards never quite comes into focus. One never really believes that he's a writer, or that he was ever the great lover, the rakish satyr, that he describes himself as having been. He's too stuffy, too middle-class. Instead, he comes off as a sort of garden-variety misogynist, a worrywart, an egotist who puts himself at the center of every story. Perhaps this was Mr. Roper's intention -- to create a character who embodied the self-absorption of the 60's. But memory can be an unmerciful muse. And not only can Richards finally remember the 60's, he must live with the uncertain moral questions engendered by those times. Stricken with an irradiated sense of regret, he ends up a haunted figure, one who engenders our sympathy, if not our admiration.HOW FREE WAS FREE LOVE?",The Day the 60's Died,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/books/the-day-the-60s-died.html

Of people arrested in the 22 largest cities, the Federal Government has found that 55 to 80 percent test positive for drug use. Meanwhile, studies show that a few heavy users commit a disproportionate share of street crimes. Heavy heroin addicts, known among criminal-justice experts as ""predators,"" for example, commit 10 times as many thefts, 15 times as many robberies, 20 times as many burglaries as offenders who don't use drugs.

He says he has found what he regards as surprisingly positive results in a therapeutic community in a state prison on Staten Island with prisoners who on average had been arrested four times. The study of 450 prisoners who started the program between 1977 and 1984 found that 27 percent were rearrested in the three years after they left prison. That compared with a 41 percent rate for those who had no treatment at all. Lipton, a researcher at National Development and Research Institutes, a nonprofit corporation for drug and AIDS research in New York, argues that if prisons target the worst predators, good programs could have a striking impact on street crime. A program in the Oregon State Hospital in Salem showed that 71 percent of the program's graduates were not reincarcerated within three years after release, compared with only 26 percent of inmates who dropped out in less than one month. In addition, studies of graduates of therapeutic communities outside of prisons, where most therapeutic communities operate, show significant reduction in long-term drug use.",The Detoxing of Prisoner 88A0802,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/magazine/the-detoxing-of-prisoner-88a0802.html

But the plates' fate thereafter was uncertain. The new theory holds that the plates, carrying a burden of oceanic sediment built up over many millions of years, get recycled within the mantle into a system of giant plumes of hot rock which burst to the surface millions of years later.","Earth's Crust Sinks Deep, Only to Rise in Plumes of Lava",https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/science/earth-s-crust-sinks-deep-only-to-rise-in-plumes-of-lava.html

430617,1993-05-23,nyt://article/801e4017-084f-5727-8f88-bd511d089f90,2.0,"This has been a curious century for medicine. As medical science and technology have grown, they have focused more and more on diseases and body parts while pushing aside the individual patient. Physicians are now frequently considered technicians, and many of their patients, looking for someone who really cares about them, have been turning away from conventional medicine and seeking alternative care. Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that many physicians would search out ways to hold onto scientific medicine while learning the healing effects of paying attention to sick people, and not just their diseases. But is there anything scientifically verifiable about the power of healing? This is the question Bill Moyers addresses in ""Healing and the Mind."" The book is interesting, thoughtful, well written and beautifully illustrated. If you think that science is the only way to know whatever is worth knowing, this won't change your opinion. But if you wonder about the relation between mind and body and between healing and health, this is a good place to start. Since the book is an edited transcript of a public-television series, Mr. Moyers asks many naive questions and seems to vacillate between doubting the healers he interviews and expecting too much from them. Mr. Moyers, as always, strives to fit what he is seeing and hearing into ordinary experience and language. When it comes to healers, for instance, his personal touchstone is his childhood doctor in Marshall, Tex., who was concerned not just about young Bill's body but about his whole family.",IN SHORT: NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/books/in-short-nonfiction.html

One way to describe the flavor of his book ""Natural Affairs"" is to say that it is like a slide show.

Highway Toll In 1991, 4,340 large trucks were in fatal motor-vehicle accidents, killing 4,814 people. They accounted for 12 percent of the 41,462 fatal motor-vehicle crashes that year. How Big Is a Big Rig? A typical single has 18 wheels and is 70 feet long. The maximum weight permitted is 80,000 pounds, heavier than a brontosaurus. The biggest rig allowed, by special permit, is a triple, which can be as long as 120 feet and can weigh up to 135,000 pounds -- 45 times the weight of an average sedan. I've Got You Under My Wheels Most trucks now have either air brakes or hydraulic brakes; both systems become hot if used repeatedly and work less efficiently. In a test, loaded trucks with hot brakes stopped in 370 feet at 55 m.p.h., instead of 196 feet with cool brakes. On the Road Again A tractor-trailer with mechanical defects is twice as likely to be involved in a crash. In a three-day nationwide inspection last year, 26 percent of trucks were found to have defects serious enough to require taking them out of service. It's Always Fair Weather Seven out of ten truck accidents occurred under favorable weather and road conditions. Let's Get Together for Breakfast ""One day we had an overturned milk truck and then an overturned doughnut truck,"" says Donna Fiducia, former reporter for Shadow Traffic and now news director at WNEW-FM. ""If only we could have gotten them together."" Loose Change A tractor-trailer carrying 3,200,000 quarters tipped over on a ramp in Chester, Pa., blocking the road for six hours while workmen scooped up the $800,000. Other Things a Big Rig Might Be Carrying A tractor-trailer crashed and dumped 20 tons of sodium cyanide on Interstate 55 near Grenada, Miss. Sodium cyanide, used in gas chambers, is lethal when wet. The weather was fair that day. Get Your Kicks on Route 66 In an eight-state study, one-third of fatally injured truck drivers tested positive for one or more of the following drugs: 13 percent for marijuana, 13 percent for alcohol, 9 percent for cocaine, 8 percent for nonprescription stimulants and 7 percent for prescription stimulants. May We See Your Brakes, Please? Antilock brakes are designed to keep wheels from locking during braking. They are required in the European Community, where, according to Chuck Hurley of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, ""jackknife accidents are virtually unknown."" But, of the 1.2 million truck cabs on American highways, fewer than 5 percent have antilock braking systems. Antilock Gridlock A Federal mandate for antilock brakes was in effect from 1975 to 1978, but a court overturned the regulation. The antilock devices ""were failing, and they took the brakes along with them,"" recalls Larry Strawhorn of American Trucking Associations. ""We had many instances of drivers coming in white as a sheet."" One problem was electronic interference. ""Some of the cables that ran to the computer were 50 feet long,"" says Strawhorn, ""and that made a dandy antenna. They'd be picking up radio signals from airports and such, which would shut off the brakes all of a sudden. Some stoplights give off these signals, so guys would go right through the intersection."" Something to Think About In Traffic Jams ""It's really a big deal when a tractor-trailer crashes,"" says Neal Busch, who has flown choppers for WCBS-AM for 25 years. ""First, there are the injuries to take care of, and the authorities want to document the circumstances thoroughly. Then there's the sheer mass of the damaged truck to extract, and often the ordinary clearing equipment is not adequate. Then there's the cargo that ends up on the road. I've seen front-loaders trying to thread their way through bumper-to-bumper traffic to pick up spoiled cargo, and sometimes they have to put down a compound to absorb chemicals. It's really a terrible problem."" Six Days on the Road, and I'm Gonna Make It Home Tonight Drivers who have been behind the wheel for more than eight hours on the Interstates are almost twice as likely to crash as well-rested drivers. On a 1,200-mile stretch from Washington State to Minnesota, researchers estimated, more than half the tractor-trailer drivers were in violation of their service regulations on rest, which stipulate that 10 hours of driving must be followed by 8 hours off-duty. I Did It All in One Trip The longest Interstate highway is I-90, which runs 3,107 miles from Boston to Seattle. Who's Keeping Score In 40 percent of large-truck fatalities, the cause was driver error, like ""driving too fast for conditions or exceeding the speed limit"" (23 percent), ""failure to keep in lane or running off the road"" (16 percent) and ""failure to yield right of way"" (15 percent). Keep On Truckin' Grim as the picture may appear, trucker safety is actually gaining ground. The number of fatal truck accidents dropped 17 percent, from 4,928 in 1981 to 4,090 in 1991, at the same time that total miles traveled by trucks rose 38.7 percent. Light at the End of the Holland Tunnel? Federal regulations move more slowly than rush-hour traffic, but improved antilock brakes are making headway. Safety advocates would like to see a rule in place before the next Presidential election. Truckers, concerned with retraining drivers and the expense of refitting equipment, would like to see it put off for a while -- until the year 2000, to be precise.",Jackknifed,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/magazine/jackknifed.html
