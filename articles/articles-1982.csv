The Jamaican reggae musicians, poets and mystics who drift through Mr. Greenberg's first film, ''Land of Look Behind,'' could easily be mistaken for subjects in a hypnosis experiment that somehow went awry. But one suspects that they are simply in a haze of smoking the potent marijuana cigars that the island's Rastafarians call ''spliffs.''",JAMAICA IS THE 'LAND OF LOOK BEHIND',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/26/movies/jamaica-is-the-land-of-look-behind.html

It begins in Trelawney Parish, in the Look Behind forest, where a countryman warns of ''sinkholes, cliffs that drop off, that you fall off and you die, and you are never seen again.'' Next, the roving camera moves along to Mr. Marley's funeral, and to a dreadlocked Rasta on a Kingston street corner who says, ''Reggae is the best, not just a little rocky-rocky something. Some people think Mr. Marley's death is a blow to reggae. We miss him, yes, but the work must go on.''",JAMAICA IS THE 'LAND OF LOOK BEHIND',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/26/movies/jamaica-is-the-land-of-look-behind.html

The camera passes Gun Court, a prison stockade where a man cries out through a slit in the wall, ''My name is Keith, man. Life sentence.'' And finally we take a dirt road back to Look Behind, where Rastas smoke their dutchies (pipes) and let their bloodshot gazes rest on the whitecaps of the Caribbean, and on the horizon that separates Central and South America from Africa.",JAMAICA IS THE 'LAND OF LOOK BEHIND',https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/26/movies/jamaica-is-the-land-of-look-behind.html

It said that penalties would definitely be imposed if a French subsidiary of Dresser Industries proceeded with a shipment of compressors for the Soviet project, and the Commerce Department put the penalty process in motion.

National A major retrenchment for Exxon calls for the closing of 850 service stations in the Northeast and Middle West and a sharp cut in production capacity at the corporation's major New Jersey refinery.

A study on alcoholism was repudiated by a researcher who organized it. Dr. Halmuth Schaefer said a new inquiry by other researchers had left ''no question'' that the widely quoted 1970-71 experiment had concluded wrongly that alcoholics could be taught to drink in moderation.

In an unusual plea bargain that followed an eight-month Justice Department investigation, Mr. Richmond acknowledged he had evaded Federal income taxes, possessed marijuana cigarettes and made an illegal payment to a Navy employee to help obtain contracts at the former Brooklyn Navy Yard. (A1:6.) Mr. Richmond is a rich businessman who gained wide attention for civic activities. In Brooklyn, politicians said he had been an effective Representative for his district, but in Washington, Congressional staff members said his effectiveness had waned since his 1978 admission that he had solicited a young man for sex acts.

On the contrary, electronic communications and jet-age transportation have made it possible to stay in closer contact than ever before. Rather, there is a sense that our connections are somehow inadequate. The cause of this dissatisfaction is elusive. To some extent, experts say, it has to do with the ascendance of a culture that places so much emphasis on acquiring possessions and status that most people devote little time or energy to forming and maintaining relationships. Exaggerated expectations created by the idealized versions of life on television, in films and in the scores of ''self-help'' books on the best-seller lists may also play a role. And because of increasing freedom and mobility, ties to spouses, family, church and community unravel more easily. The America de Tocqueville traveled through was a rural country in which the ties holding people together were essentially those of family and community. Some of the current alarm stems from looking at the 1980 census and seeing how complete the progressive dissolution of those ties now seems to be. More people live alone today than ever before: almost one fourth of the population. Within this group are a large number of people under 40 who, for a variety of reasons, have chosen not to marry. The women in this group are often the first women in their families to live alone. A generation earlier, they would have become housewives; now they are working or going to school instead.

The three of them hit it off and decided to spend some time together, drinking beer, smoking marijuana and joy riding. Suddenly, without any warning or apparent provocation, Charles Decker attacked the girls with a stone mason's hammer, fracturing their skulls severely enough to require brain surgery. Then just as suddenly, he came to his senses, dropped the girls where they could be taken to a hospital quickly, called his father and turned himself over to the police.",BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/26/books/books-of-the-times-039831.html

Nor do the authors of this account, Andre Mayer and Michael Wheeler, pretend that it was. They deal wth it mainly for its implications. For Charles Decker's lawyer came up wth a novel defense. He argued that his client was innocent by reason of insanity, but not for any familiar psychogenic cause. Instead he set out to prove that Charles Decker had suffered chemical damage to the most primitive part of his brain, the limbic system, and that consequently he lacked the means to control his urge to violence.",BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/26/books/books-of-the-times-039831.html

Assuming that rehabilitation were the only true purpose of a criminal-justice system (and this is an assumption almost no one would be willing to grant), are we likely to be able to ''cure'' crime once we determine the physical basis of it. In Charles Decker's case, knowing the approximate cause of his problem hasn't helped; his seizures of violence have continued, and the prosecuting attorney in the case has said that he expects one of these days to learn that Charles Decker has hurt somebody else.

Would that mean that no psychogenic or sociological elements were involved? And would solving the biochemical problem necessarily clear up the cause of the crime? In Charles Decker's case, there seems to me to have been a psychological cause for his outburst that is just as plausible as the biochemical one.

As long ago as 1806, a man in Baltimore named George Bourne published a book called ''The Spirit of the Public Journals: Or, Beauties of the American Newspapers for 1805.'' But newspaper writing being so perishable, they are not common. Bourne did not bring out any more volumes of beautiful newspaper passages, and very few other people have either. The occasional modern anthology is as apt to be a contribution to sociology as to literature. For example, Marjorie Longley's New York Times anthology, published in 1960, exists to illustrate a trend. She went through a full century of The Times looking for descriptions of cultural events and then she used them to show how American taste had changed.",IRREVERENCE AND OUTRAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/18/books/irreverence-and-outrage.html

The study said the service had cut costs and improved productivity, but, in doing so, had sacrificed employee courtesy and customer services. (B13:4-6.) There is uncertainty in Arizona and New Mexico whether the two states can continue to absorb wave after wave of emigres and avoid the urban problems that prompted many of them to flee the industrial centers of the North. (B12:3-6.) Metropolitan Uniformed workers demonstrated in an effort to persuade New York City to increase its wage offer for a new contract. About 8,000 off-duty police officers, firefighters and correction officers marched slowly from Union Square down lower Broadway to City Hall, where they held a rally. (A1:1.) A toxic waste dump-cancer link was suggested in New Jersey. A study by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey found mortality rates from cancer among white males living near such dumps in three counties was 25 to 50 percent above the national average. The university has been updating a study by the National Cancer Institute in 1972 that was said to have found that all of New Jersey was a cancer ''hot spot.'' (B1:6.) A major auto insurance fraud was reported by New York State officials. They said that a large concern, Claridge Brokerage, had misappropriated premiums paid by thousands of motorists, generating losses estimated at $4 million to $6 million to the assigned risk plan, in which all the state's auto insurers participate. As a result, they said, all motorists had to pay higher charges. (B2:5-6.) A building renovation program can be continued despite contentions that state legislation authorizing the program expired on June 1, according to New York City's Corporation Council, Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr. He expressed the view that the city could legally continue to operate the program, known as J-51, which provides tax benefits to spur rehabilitation of rundown buildings. (A1:3-4.) A lawsuit over defective ambulances was filed by New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Four months ago, it said it had arranged for the faults to be corrected by the manufacturer. The agency seeks $2.5 million in damages for the defects in 40 new ambulances bought last year from Prestige Vehicles Inc.

Its men and materiel had been squandered in I Corps; 13,066 Marines were killed in action, another 51,392 wounded. Race riots raged in barracks and along the back alleys of garrison towns at home and abroad. Rates for desertion and unauthorized absences soared. So did the number of experienced Marines who took their dogtags off for good.

Because of the importance of commanding in combat - it is all a part of having your ticket punched, advancing your way up the M.M.'s career ladder - there is a discernible yearning among young marines for a chance to mix it up in Nicaragua, Aden, anywhere. ''It's like going to medical school and studying anatomy for years but never even getting near a cadaver,'' says one. Another fear is that they may draw recruiting duty. It is all well and good that Barrow has decreed that a recruiting tour, three years or so of making the rounds of college and high-school campuses, is the peace-time equivalent of combat. But for an up-and-coming officer, it can be a double-edged sword.

The corps, which already has three squadrons of an older-model Harrier, likes the plane because with its vertical-takeoff capability it does not need a paved runway or a carrier flight deck. It can be based nearer front lines and thus can make more bombing runs in support of the grunts on the ground.

(They also screen in sperm, keeping it from coming into contact wath the blood. When this particular barrier breaks down, antibodies are formed against the sperm, causing them to clump or to become immobile. Vasectomy reversals sometimes fail because sperm has invaded the bloodstream - by way of the cut tubes - and resulted in the production of antibodies.)

He held up a glossy black and white picture of a single sperm with clumps of bacteria clinging to it. ''This sperm has one, two, three, ... 13 bacteria on it,'' he explained. ''But it's still moving. Visualize that this sperm dies in the woman's tube. Do you think the bacteria would die? Why would they? Now, consider how often we attribute infertility to tubal factors, to chronic pelvic infection and so on. But here you see that it is the male who is the carrier of this bacteria.''",FIGHTING MALE INFERTILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/magazine/fighting-male-infertility.html

A number of other sexually transmitted bacteria are found in the same relative numbers, leading Dr. Toth to speculate that he will be able to demonstrate other links between extensive sexual activity (with or without a history of venereal disease) and infertility. Out of nearly 6,000 male patients he has seen in the last three years, he believes that he can trace infertility to venereally transmitted bacteria in close to half of them.",FIGHTING MALE INFERTILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/magazine/fighting-male-infertility.html

''I think there's an overemphasis on mycoplasma,'' says Dr. Amelar. ''It may cause some problems, but I don't think it can be attributed to 50 percent - it's more like 5 percent.'' And in tests on 150 couples at the Fertility Research Foundation, Dr. Cohen has found no correlation between mycoplasma and infertility in men. He also believes that the antibiotic treatment used to cure mycoplasma infections may itself be harmful to sperm production. Almost any drug in excess seems a potential suspect. Reports have shown that marijuana may cause chromosomal anomalies which can lead to genetic damage, and it may also produce temporary infertility by lowering sperm counts, sperm motility and possibly levels of the male sex hormone testosterone. Most fertility specialists advise their patients not to smoke marijuana. However, even experts such as Dr. Wylie Hembree, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, who has done a number of studies on the effects of marijuana on male fertility, say that the results are still somewhat inconclusive. Even so, Dr. Hembree adds, ''although additional studies are needed to understand fully the implications, the results are of sufficient concern so that we advise anyone trying to have children to refrain from the regular use of marijuana.''",FIGHTING MALE INFERTILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/magazine/fighting-male-infertility.html

Drugs currently used in the treatment of such chronic illnesses as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, gout, epilepsy and other nervous-system disorders all have been shown to have an effect on the quality of sperm produced. Drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system - such as guanethidine (sold under the brand names Ismelin or Esimil), which is used for patients with high blood pressure - may cause infertility by producing an aberration called retrogade ejaculation. The man has all the sensations of ejaculation but the semen goes backward, into the bladder. Another high-bloodpressure drug is Inderal, which has not been found to cause ejaculation problems but sometimes produces impotence. Inderal, incidentally, is a brand of propranolol hydrochloride, which, along with other so-called ''beta-blockers,'' has recently been found to be effective in preventing second heart attacks among cardiac patients; propranolol has rapidly become the second most widely prescribed drug in the United States. In all the publicity attendant on its newfound heart-attack function, virtually no mention has been made of possible sexual side effects, although fertility doctors consider them a potential problem. One of the environmental effects that seems the most innocuous is also one of the most common: heat. If the testes are at or above the body temperature for any length of time, the sperm cells will stop maturing properly. (An undescended testicle fails to produce sperm because, among other reasons, it is too hot.) Drs. Amelar and Dubin see many heat-related cases in their practice. Frequent hot baths are a problem, they say, whether they're taken for health reasons (to soothe a bad back or hemorrhoids), for religious reasons (the ritual mikvah bath is practiced by Orthodox Jewish men as well as women), or for recreation or relaxation (sitting in a sauna or hot tub). ''Sitting in a hot bath ... it's the same principle as cooking rice,'' Dr. Dubin says. ''If you just pour hot water over the rice it's going to take a lot longer to cook it. We tell our patients to take showers.'' Another way to overheat the testicles is by jogging in a rubber sweatsuit - literal hot pants.

Back in the 1950's, fluoroscopes were used to measure children's shoe sizes, and many shoe salesmen suffered from fertility problems as a result.

Amelar and Dubin, think it may be reversible. In a 1958 accident at Oak Ridge, Tenn., five of eight men exposed to high doses of radiation were rendered virtually sterile. Within 21 months, however, the men had begun to produce sperm once again, and 41 months after exposure they had reattained a ''reasonable'' level of fertility. Radiation therapy for treatment of cancer also harms sperm production. Radiation works on rapidly dividing sperm cells exactly as it attacks rapidly dividing cancer cells. Again, the effect is devastating but usually temporary. Four years after such treatment, most men will be more or less back to normal. Young boys are much more sensitive to the effects of radiation, and the damage is irreversible. Drs. Dubin and Amelar recommend strongly that radiation for diagnostic and especially for therapeutic purposes be avoided as much as possible on prepubertal boys. A large number of men have in the last few years come to terms with the fact that they cannot father children - something few men have had to face directly before at any time in history. It is difficult, as the man quoted at the beginning of this article says: ''I guess that sex and procreation are more intertwined than we like to think. To find out you're sterile makes you realize that every time you had sex with somebody there was always a grain of thought that you could have a child. Women have to face the fact that they can't have children after a certain age. I'm sure that causes emotional problems of its own. But a man takes it for granted that he's going to be able to father a child any time he wants in his life. Picasso had a child when he was 67.

It is not surprising that men feel there is something shameful in their condition when both society at large and many doctors continue to have ambiguous feelings. Dr. Dubin blames some of the increased incidence of fertility complaints on the women's movement - on the fact that women are interested in having careers as well as babies and may delay the latter.

As native speakers of a dialect regard the official language, we may regard language itself: It is for dealing with the outsiders; between ourselves we have little need of it.

The title tune is an accompaniment for break dancing, the showy, acrobatic style practiced by ''crews'' of teen-agers who are usually neighborhood buddies. It's basically a chant. A brusque, chromatic keyboard figure pops up every once in awhile as punctuation, and there are occasional synthesizer noises that sound like the bleeping of a parlor full of video games, but for the most part ''Drop the Bomb'' is street music -voices and drumming.","ANGER GONE, GRAHAM PARKER IS BACK",https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/05/arts/the-pop-life-anger-gone-graham-parker-is-back.html

But even the album's ballad ''Don't Try To Use Me'' is appealingly raw and heartfelt. And this rawness is what makes Trouble Funk's first album so special. Compared to ''Drop the Bomb,'' even the hardest major-label funk records sound glossy and slick. It's possible that Trouble Funk sounds raw because they couldn't afford a top-drawer studio and producer, that they'd like to sound as polished as Slave or Cameo or any other major-label funk band. But they don't sound like a major-label funk band; they sound like a band with a lot of ideas and energy and an unselfconscious feel for the sounds and rhythms of the streets.

In the mid-1970's, when other criticswere writing reverently about Jamaican reggae, Mr. Bangs went to Jamaica and wrote a scathing report for the fan magazine Creem on certain reggae stars' marijuana-clouded maunderings and their hideously chauvinistic attitudes toward women.

And despite the efforts of Victorian reformers like Dickens' and Mayhew to portray the criminal life in its sordid reality (""Oliver Twist"" in particular was intended as a corrective), the romance of the underworld and its language was unabated at the end of the century, when Beerbohm wrote of Masefield: ""A swear-word in a rustic slum/ A simple swear-word is to some,/ To Masefield something more."" The fascination is easy enough to understand. For the Victorians and their successors, the underworld was just what its name implied, a nether region as dark, as elaborate and as circumscribed as Dante's.

She goes to work for an intense, moody graduate student who runs a ''tutoring'' service for football scholarship students, ''tutoring'' service being a euphemism for a term-paper writing operation that is paid for by the Athletics Department. At first Kate feels that ''it's cheating,'' but she needs the money and is attracted to Brock, her boss, who encourages her rationalizations: ''You've got to work the angles to get by.

Paul had left home at 16, at the climax of a long slow estrangement from his mother and grandfather that began with his father's death from cancer and ended with an unjust accusation of statutory rape. Teaching sailing, he'd been becalmed in fog with 14-year-old Mary Lou, the daughter of strict religious parents who had recently moved to Long Island from Texas.

It has thrived and entered the world of the 1980's in a big way. A number of contemporary economic and social currents have, in fact, converged there: The shift of wealth to the Sun Belt. The rise to power of the Oil Patch states, especially Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, in the wake of the meteoric rise of petroleum prices during the 1970's. The resurgence of small towns generally, as the flow of population toward the cities and suburbs begins to reverse itself. And, not least, the sexual and feminist revolutions. Yet the Protestant, fundamentalist core remains largely intact. And for this reason, Archer City, which is perhaps representative of hundreds of other places like it, is possibly a better barometer of the relative permanence of social change than bigger cities where trends are set and fashions come and go.

An ordinary atoll, usually a ring of coral islets around a lagoon, has a maximum height of 10 feet or so. According to geologists, Nauru sank beneath the sea and rose again several times. Each dunking collected layers of marine organisms on the basic coral formation, which eventually hardened into coral limestone. On top of this, over millenniums, countless sea birds deposited a thick blanket of guano. This mixture of dung and marine material, compacted between pillars of coral, formed phosphate rock, or phosphate of lime.Nauru's beds, extracted by mechanical scoops, assay up to 84 percent pure phosphate, the highest grade known.",WORLD'S RICHEST LITTLE ISLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/magazine/world-s-richest-little-isle.html

An aide to Mr. Reagan said that the Rev. B. Sam Hart, a black minister from Philadelphia, had asked the White House to rescind his nomination following protests from civil rights organizations and the two Republican Senators from Pennsyvania. (1:4.) Legal arguments for tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools were presented by the Reagan Administration to the Supreme Court. One of the three lawyers who signed the brief told the Court in a footnote that he disagreed with the Administration's position and said that the Administration had taken the opposite position in a brief he filed on its behalf in September. The Court had planned to take up a case involving the tax exemption issue at its closed conference Friday, according to lawyers, but was not expected to take any public action until Monday. (8:3-6.) Some compromise with the President on his 1983 budget request may be linked to an unavoidable vote in Congress this spring on the national debt ceiling limit, Republican Congressional leaders believe.

Marijuana has adverse effects on behavior and the body, according to a long-awaited report by the National Academy of Sciences, but the report said that these effects were short-term and that reliable evidence was so scanty that it is impossible to draw any firm conclusions about the drug's potential long-term health hazards. Dr. Arnold S. Relman, chairman of the special panel of health authorities that prepared the report, said that ''what little we know for certain'' is cause for serious national concern.'' (1:5.) The biggest TV contract in the history of show business is about to signed by the National Football League and the three major television networks, which last season had record pro-football ratings for the telecasts of the league's games.

A mummified insect has been found with some of its soft tissues intact after 40 million years, scientists at the University of California at Berkeley reported. They said the specimen is so remarkably well preserved that elements within cells appear to be visible. One scientist hopes to extract some intact genetic material from the specimen with the hope that it can be replicated. (1:1-2.) Revamping of F.H.A. operations has been recommended by President Reagan's Commission on Housing. The 30-member advisory panel said that the Federal Housing Administration should turn over much of its work to private mortgage insurance companies, and that the Government generally should not compete with the private market in providing insurance for home mortgages. If the recommendation is put into effect, it would the leave the F.H.A. with responsibility for testing the value of new mortgage instruments and providing mortgage insurance for people who could not get it from private companies.

Metropolitan Danger of savings bank failures in New York City was indicated by a record loss of $337 million by New York City's savings banks in the fourth quarter of 1981, bringing the total loss for the year to $1 billion, the State Banking Department reported. The prospect of failures is expected to exert considerable pressure on the Reagan Administration and on Congress to adopt measures to help the beleaguered thrift institutions. (1:1.) Endorsement of Bruce Caputo as a candidate for the Senate was ''suspended'' by Republican and Conservative Party leaders as a result of disclosures that he had inaccurately described his military record.

Subway service was cut off on much of the West Side of Manhattan, and many buildings there lost water pressure when a major water main burst at 40th Street and Broadway.

A second Turk was arrested in connection with the attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul II last year. The West German authorities said that Omer Ay, a Turkish fugitive sought for right-wing activities, had been seized in Hamburg after he committed a minor traffic violation. (A8:1-2.) National A grim choice for G.M. workers was outlined by Douglas A. Fraser, president of the United Automobile Workers. He said that the union members employed by General Motors faced the probable choice of accepting a sharp rollback in wages and benefits next fall or of calling a strike from a position of tactical weakness.

Labor told Vice President Bush that the Reagan Administration was practicising ''Jonestown economics'' with a proposed 1983 budget that ''administers economic Kool-Aid to the poor, the deprived and the unemployed.''

But why should the cinema tie itself down to naturalism? After all, the greatest living director is Luis Bunel, who is a poetic anarchist. And the great commercial successes of the moment, like the 'Star Wars' and 'Superman' sequences, are all fantasies - though admittedly fantasies without any weight or reverberation. In fact, America is sweeping the screens of the world with essays in infantilism. But audiences like circuses: in an age of bland, conformist television they hunger for extremism.

B. Forster's ''A Passage to India''). But it was much more to do with the conditions of a British cinema that never knows quite what to do with its home-grown artists. As Mr. Anderson says, Britain lacks a large enough home-market for cinema; there is a high resistance to most British films in the States; and those who have the muscle to get movies made often turn out mid-Atlantic product. But though he talks apocalyptically of ''the twilight of cinema'' he still believes the medium has room for the dissident individual voice and the satirical sharpshooter; and he clearly hopes that ''Britannia Hospital'' will offer some universally-acknowledged truths about the vanity of science, medicine, the media and professional agitators.",LINDSAY ANDERSON BREWS SOME CHAOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/17/movies/lindsay-anderson-brews-some-chaos.html

Certain drugs have specific side effects, such as red eyes (marijuana), weight loss (cocaine), appetite increase (marijuana), general paranoia (angel dust).",PARENTS' QUESTION ON DRUGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/nyregion/parents-question-on-drugs.html

Take control and stay in control. Talk calmly. Do not shout or become hysterical. Be knowlegeable about drugs so you can discuss the subject intelligently with your child. Get to know the parents of your children's friends and exchange ideas about curfews and other standards of behavior for teen-agers. Work together to provide chaperones for parties. Parents should keep each other informed. Q: What do I do if the parents of my child's best friend smoke marijuana at home themselves? A: That is a tough and increasingly frequent situation. You have to decide for yourself whether you want to forbid your child to go to that friend's house. It is very confusing for an adolescent to be told by his or her parents that something is wrong and then to find other parents sanctioning it. Such situations are obviously best avoided. Q: When my child asks what qualifies me to talk about drugs when I have never tr ied them, what do I say? A: Tell him t here are a lot of things you have not done that you knoware not good for you - like jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. Q: When my child says there is no difference between my having a drink when I come home at night and his or her having a joint of marijuana after school, what do I answer? A: First of all, you are not breaking the law by having a drink, while nonprescription use of marijuana is illegal. You have your drink not to get drunk, but to relax, whereas the only reason for smoking marijuana is to get high. Q: Isn't marijuana relatively harmless? A: Recent research indicates that it has adve rse effects on the lungs, the brain, the immune system and the r eproductive systems of both men and women. It appears to have cancer potential and to cause damage to the lungs' antibacterial defenses, as well as interfere with pulmonary functions.
