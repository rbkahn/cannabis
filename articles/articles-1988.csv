Sullivan observes about halfway through his two-month, 1,361-mile walk across the Wilderness Areas of Oregon. ''Wilderness is marvelous that way,'' he writes in LISTENING FOR COYOTE: A Walk Across Oregon's Wilderness (illustrated, 239 pp., Morrow, $17.95). ''It is possible for people who lead city lives to walk for two hours and put themselves on the side of a snow-frosted mountain, exposed to the genuine danger of being surprised by rain or snow or mud or rocks or animals - or themselves.'' Mr. Sullivan sets out, apparently goaded by a desperate anxiety to see whether the wilderness is still there, to scout a ''new Oregon Trail'' across the Klamath, the Cascades, the Ochocos, the Blue Mountains and ending at last in Hell's Canyon. He gets cold, he gets hungry, he gets hurt. He greets the flora and fauna and rejoices in solitude and listens for Coyote, the Indian trickster spirit of the wilderness. He observes and chronicles the United States Forest Service's obsessive encroaching efforts to log, to graze, to use wilderness areas. An endearing and engaging writer, Mr. Sullivan is at his best when he describes the people he meets along his way: a Vietnam veteran protecting his marijuana crop, an ancient widow farming from an incredibly remote and rickety miner's cabin, a ''wilderness theologian'' whose spiritual quest is to save Soda Mountain from the logging plans of the Bureau of Land Management. *",TRAVEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/books/christmas-books-travel.html

''The entire population of California, greater than that of Canada or the rest of the western states, lives within a day's drive of the [ Sierra Nevada ] ,'' Mr. Palmer writes, and 76 percent of the mountain range is owned by the Government. The whole range is essentially under siege, threatened by timber harvesting, dams, water diversion, mining, urban development, grazing - even by the hordes of nature lovers. Mr. Palmer visits places like the casinos around Lake Tahoe and the campgrounds of Yosemite, talking, collecting facts, always conscious of the legacy of John Muir, the original Western conservationist.

So, too, does the writer and photographer Stan Grossfeld's book THE WHISPER OF STARS: A Siberian Journey (illustrated, 150 pp., Globe Pequot Press, $22.95 until Jan. 1; $24.95 thereafter). But he is taking the reader to Siberia, a place that was once almost unimaginably different. He insists on going in the winter, to get the full Siberian effect, and he lets the reader know at once that he was not allowed to visit any gulags. Nor does he ever succeed in hearing the whisper of the stars - a phenomenon that occurs at, say, minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit when each breath turns to a cloud of icy crystals, ''Shhh. Shhh. Shhh.'' From the genial and unpretentious text that accompanies Mr. Grossfeld's remarkable pictures, it would seem that he saw almost everything else.

But when Lady Mary Wortley Montagu set out from London in 1716 with her ambassador husband, her child, her enormous entourage of servants and wagonloads of baggage, the journey overland to Istanbul had not been ''undertaken by any Christian'' for some hundred years. Lady Mary was a bright light of England's Age of Reason, yet the letters written during her 15 months abroad were not published until after her death more than 40 years later, and even then much to the horror of her prudish daughter. This new selection of her letters, EMBASSY TO CONSTANTINOPLE: The Travels of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (edited by Christopher Pick, illustrated, 224 pp., New Amsterdam, $30), which relies heavily on Robert Halsband's authoritative edition, has charming pictures and notes, and proves again that for style, candor, narrative sense and reporter's eye she deserved the praise the first edition received from Smollett, Dr. Johnson and Voltaire. Visiting a women's bath she reported: '' [ They ] would fain have undressed me for the bath. I excused myself with some difficulty. . . . I was at last forced to open my skirt and show them my stays, which satisfied 'em very well, for I saw they believed I was so locked up in that machine that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.'' She considered the veils of Turkish women a convenience - since no one could recognize them, they could go to such assignations as they wished. But more appealing to her, unhappily married to a miser, was the fact that wealthy Turkish women retained their own money even after marriage. Lady Mary brought back from Turkey the discovery of inoculation against smallpox, and crusaded successfully for it in England against ferocious opposition denouncing her as defying God's will.

Originally published in 1958, the book now includes her superb appendices but no updated introduction, although Freya Stark's Turkey is now as remote as Lady Mary's. Still, Dame Freya, now 95 years old and certainly the greatest living travel writer, defies updating. She must be left to ride her donkey forever along the empty beaches and the roadless valleys of the 50's Turkish landscape, now lined with yachts and furrowed by Mercedes buses. She, like Homer, Alexander and Croesus, is part of the history of the country. Enchanted by Alexander the Great, ''the most dynamic being that the world has perhaps ever known,'' she writes in the perfect confidence that her readers are equally enchanted, and thoroughly versed in her hero's history. ''The way of life they planted has endured . . . binding all with that invisible thread which was once the Greco-Roman world,'' she writes. ''What it failed to reach has mostly remained barbarous even today, and for my part I have no wish ever to live beyond its decent orbit.'' This is a sensibility, indeed an education, that scarcely survives. And yet, she was simultaneously fully engaged in the present, noticing, describing: ''the women, wrapped in black above their baggy trousers, came riding behind [ the sheep ] , with only one eye showing and the cloth held in their mouth to leave their hands free, looking like one of Durer's ideas of death.'' *",TRAVEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/books/christmas-books-travel.html

Parsons' I DIDN'T HEAR THE DRAGON ROAR (with Donna L. Chitwood, illustrations by Anh Vu, 251 pp., Gallaudet University, $17.95). Mr. Danziger was a 26-year-old British artist when he set out in 1984 with a small grant from the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust to re-trace the ancient trade routes known as the Silk Route. He emerged in Beijing 18 months later, having traveled with only a small backpack, almost no visas and several extremely official-looking letters across Europe, Turkey, Iran, war-torn Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tibet and finally all over China. ''I needed almost to dice with death (though I have never, and would never, take an uncalculated risk), because sometimes you simply have to live on the edge to appreciate the vitality of life,'' he writes, and his book is an exciting and very interesting account of his confrontation with the world. He picks up languages, travels dangerously with the Afghan rebels, sleeps wherever he can and always, everywhere, argues doggedly with obstructing officials. He mourns the disappearance of differences, the electronic homogenization of cultures. His proudest moment seems to have been winning permission, with great difficulty, to cross the Khunjerab pass from Pakistan into China.",TRAVEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/books/christmas-books-travel.html

Parsons is ''60 plus,'' an American, and she seems to be a traveler in the great eccentric and determined literary tradition of Freya Stark. She is also deaf - thus the unheard dragon's roar - a lecturer in art history at Gallaudet University, and her stated purpose is to travel ''as an unofficial ambassador of the American deaf community.'' She spent 12 weeks traveling alone through China, all over China, including Tibet, as authentically and cheaply as possible. In Kashgar, the closest Chinese city to the Khunjerab Pass, she was kept awake by the arrival in her dormitory room of some European tourists who had just come over the pass by bus. Either the Chinese gave Mr. Danziger a hard time, were pulling his leg, or traffic increased a great deal in one year. Ms. Parsons recounts every argument with officials, every alarming meal served, every discomfort (which in China is very uncomfortable indeed). She even includes two illustrations of appalling public toilets. She makes herself understood, and she has a wonderful time. Perhaps Ms. Parsons and Mr. Danziger, both armed with important looking letters, are not so different, after all. They are both members of a unique subspecies of the human race. They are travelers, and what travelers do is travel, no matter what. The best of them take us with them in their books.",TRAVEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/books/christmas-books-travel.html

Medium- and long-shots are favored, requiring the audience to search the images for meanings that close-ups would either overstate or misrepresent in other ways. The pacing is slow compared to American films, compared even to most Japanese dramas one sees on television.

How do you define an alcoholic? A. An alcoholic is anyone who has alcohol interfere with his life, where it has caused chronic health or financial problems or problems in personal relationships. Q. Is New Jersey any different from other states with the problems of alcoholism and drug abuse? A. New Jersey has a greater problem than most states with intravenous drug use, which is our leading cause in the spread of AIDS. Our urbanization, the fact that we're a Northeast state, our high income level and the bedroom community nature of the state, all seem to generate a lot more alcoholic behavior for some reason. Q.

Q. Which is the biggest problem, the abuse of alcohol, illegal drugs such as cocaine, marijuana and heroin, or prescription drugs? A. Alcoholism is by far the leading cause of death among all the abused substances and the leader in health- care costs. Seventy-five percent of the cases of child abuse and 80 percent of the battered spouses in our criminal justice system involve alcohol. It also has major impact on lost time at work. Q. What are some of the most common misconceptions that still exist about alcoholism? A. A lot of people believe that active alcoholics can't hold down jobs, but most do, and that you can't be an active alcoholic if you drink beer, which you definitely can be. And most folks have a picture of an alcoholic as a skid row bum, which is true for only about 5 percent of all alcoholics. Q. How long does it take the average person to recover from alcoholism? What is the point at which a resumption of drinking is improbable? A. We found that individuals who stay active in Alcoholics Anonymous for a year without any use of alcohol or other chemicals have a 90 percent chance of staying sober for the rest of their lives. After two years of sobriety, the recovery rate is higher, about 95 percent, and it increases with each year of sobriety.",New Jersey Q & A: Riley W.

Success in recovery is sometimes developing one treatment program after another and is based on how soon you get to the individual, what kinds of pressures there are to keep that person in treatment - their health and their family constellation, and the number of people who surround them with understanding, love and a very firm attitude. Q. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that alcoholism, in specific circumstances, is not a disease, because its victims contributed to their own behavior and condition. Do you believe this? A. Alcoholism is clearly a disease and it is defined that way by the American Medical Association. Q. Will the Court's ruling have any effect on states like New Jersey for its recovery and prevention programs? A. I don't think so. The Supreme Court rulings upholding the definition of alcoholism, in 1968, and the most recent one, which said it was not a disease, indicate that we don't have very consistent information from the medical community. But big business and industry aren't going to stop sending their employees to treatment because the treatment works for those folks. Q. Must everyone contemplating recovery enter a residential rehabilitation facility? A. Absolutely not. Outpatient programs, in which there are counseling and attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, are indicated for perhaps more than half the people who are in residential care. Q. What directions will the division be taking in coming years? A. I think you're going to see a combining of the divisions of alcoholism and drug abuse within the Department of Health. Many of the things we do are similar. I think you'll see a greater emphasis on programs and planning at the county level.",New Jersey Q & A: Riley W.

Some people have said that alcoholic beverages are not abused by most people who drink them and that those who drink to their own and others' detriment should be held responsible, not the manufacturers and advertisers of alcoholic beverages. A. Alcohol is a chemical, a drug, and it's just as addictive as other drugs. Why do we advertise this stuff at all? It's really aimed at having people drink more and more.",New Jersey Q & A: Riley W.

Calvino, an authentic post-modernist (despite the clamor, there are not so many of these), does not experiment; the self-conscious post-modernist is also a devil-may-care post-experimenter. No one has understood the gleeful and raucous fix, or tragedy, of the latter-day artist more penetratingly than Italo Calvino. The writer's quest has traditionally been to figure out the right human questions to ask, and if we still love the novels of, say, George Eliot, it is because we are nostalgic for the sobriety of a time when the right questions could be divined. In the disorderly aftermath of Joyce, Kafka, S. Y. Agnon, Borges, all the questions appear to be used up, repetitive, irrelevant; and their answers - which only recently did take on experimental form - have been marred by struggle, stoicism and a studied ''playfulness'' more plucky than antic. After Kafka, after Borges, what is there to do but mope?","MOUTH, EAR, NOSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/mouth-ear-nose.html

He gives up narrative destination for destiny, clarification for clairvoyance. He invents a new laughter suitable to the contemporary disbelief in story. In short, Calvino readdresses - and magisterially re-enters - the idea of myth, of the tale. In earlier works, he imagined Marco Polo as Scheherazade, mesmerizing Kublai Khan with jewel-like accounts of walls, images, weather, names, humors, fates; or he noted that ''the objects of reading and writing are placed among rocks, grass, lizards, having become products of the mineral-vegetable-animal continuum.'' He even invoked - in the exhilarating pages of ''If on a Winter's Night a Traveler'' - a Father of Stories, ''the universal source of narrative material, the primordial magma.'' A learned, daring, ingeniously gifted magus, Calvino in our own time has turned himself into the Italian Grimm: his ''Italian Folktales,'' a masterwork of culling and retelling, is devoted precisely to the lure of the primordial magma - myth spawned by the body of the organic and inorganic world.","MOUTH, EAR, NOSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/mouth-ear-nose.html

The modernists have already hinted at how the fundamental story-clay, the myth-magma, can spring from taste (remember Proust's madeleine) or smell (Mann's diseased Venice) or sound (Forster's ou-boum in the Marabar Caves). Yet these merely metaphorical resonances will not content Calvino. He slides back behind them to the primary ground of perception: ganglia and synapse. He fuses fable with neuron. By driving story right down to its biological root, to cell and stimulus, he nearly annihilates metaphor. Calvino's post-modernism is a literalism so absolute that it transports myth to its organic source, confining story to limits of the mouth, the ear, the nose.","MOUTH, EAR, NOSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/mouth-ear-nose.html

The title story opens with a scrupulous recounting of Mexican cuisine (the reader is likely to salivate), and winds up in a dazzlement of wit and horror. The narrator and Olivia, a tourist couple who are vaguely estranged, are in Mexico on a holiday. They are diligent about seeing the sights and obsessive about trying every exotic dish. The husband is somewhat apathetic (''insipid,'' Olivia calls him, as if he needed seasoning) while Olivia is intense, inquisitive, perilously inspired. Her passion for food is sacerdotal, almost creedal. Studying her ''voluptuous mastication,'' the narrator is overcome by a revelation of his own: ''I realized my gaze was resting not on her eyes but on her teeth . . . which I happened to be seeing for the first time not as the radiant glow of a smile but as the instruments most suited to their purpose: to be dug into flesh, to sever it, tear it.''","MOUTH, EAR, NOSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/mouth-ear-nose.html

The very name of the latter returns them to their hotel room in a rare state of sexual arousal. And meanwhile their days are given over to exploring the ruins of ancient Aztec and Olmec civilizations - temples where human sacrifice was practiced, with the complicity of willing victims, by priests who afterward consumed a certain ''ritual meal.'' Olivia presses their guide to speculate on the possible flavors of that unspecified dish; following which, during a supper of shrimp soup and goat kid, the husband fantasizes that ''I could feel her tongue lift me against the roof of her mouth, enfold me in saliva, then thrust me under the tips of the canines. . . . The situation was not entirely passive, since while I was being chewed by her I felt also that I was acting on her, transmitting sensations that spread from the taste buds through her whole body.''

In ''A King Listens'' - the crown of this extraordinary collection - the suspected eavesdropping of spies, unidentifiable movements and whispers, signals of usurpation, mysterious knockings, the very noise of the universe, imply terror and imprisonment. The ear turns out to be the most imagining organ, because it is the most accomplished at deciphering; still, on its own, it cannot be confident of any one interpretation and wheels frenetically from conjecture to conjecture.

M. Barrie's ''Admirable Crichton.'' But Calvino's mythopoetics has no theme; the primordial magma is beyond, and below, what story is ''about.''

Calvino's aim is to juxtapose the primitive and the rococo, the coarse and the highly mannered, in order to reveal their congenital olfactory unity. To emphasize the bond of nose with nose, he constructs a somewhat blurry triptych. A decadent French gentleman visits Madame Odile's parfumerie in search of the scent of the vanished lady he waltzed with at a masked ball. A Neanderthal man-beast runs with the herd in pursuit of females, lured by the explicit odor of a single escaped female. After a bleary night of beer, marijuana and sex, the drummer of a London rock band wakes up in a cold and filthy rooming house fixed on the smell of the girl he slept with, though she has long since cleared out. In brief, the nose, no matter who is wearing it, is an aboriginal hunter. It is all too artful, too archetypal, too anthropological - and especially too programmed and thematic. No use sniffing here after the primeval mythos. The sophisticated aroma is of Calvino, writing.","MOUTH, EAR, NOSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/books/mouth-ear-nose.html

Possibly. But it is also a sign of the masterly imagination that it will respond lavishly to the moment's appetite - and appetite is elemental, the opposite of fashion. Calvino occurring in any span of decades other than those vouchsafed him is inconceivable. He was meant to flourish on the heels of Kafka. That he flourishes in an English prose equal in brio and originality to Nabokov's is owed to his noteworthy translator, William Weaver, who brings to Calvino's voice the ear, the savor and the quizzical nostrils of a fellow poet.

''Copperhead Road'' is exactly half of a brilliant album, with five smart, ornery, memorable story-songs. ''Copperhead Road,'' a cross between a Scottish reel and Mr. Springsteen's ''Born in the U.S.A.,'' is about a bootlegger's son who comes back from Vietnam and plants a marijuana patch; ''Snake Oil'' is a rowdy, barrelhouse-rock sales pitch. ''Back to the Wall'' is a Stones-y rundown of hard times; the country-rocking ''The Devil's Right Hand'' insists that a pistol will ''get you into trouble but it can't get you out.'' And the country-Celtic ''Johnny Come Lately,'' complete with pennywhistle, compares World War II romance to the bleak aftermath of Vietnam.

There are 4 of the 35 or so known Vermeers, acres of Cuyp cows in meadows, genre galore (the Dutch still call a sloppy household ''a house of Jan Steen'' after that painter's scenes of chicken bones on the floor and people in riotous drinking) and wonderfully intricate household furnishings from Holland's Golden Age.

And in that there's some Medicaid - some provisions - that will be very helpful to the kind of people we're talking about here. But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies, to me, in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered. I do not want to see us mandate across-the-board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ''We can't make it,'' and I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work. All of these programs - and this costs on his is - was - I saw an estimate - I'd love to know what he thinks - 35, 40 billion dollars -and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isn't any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. It's a terrible problem.

But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it. Don't you?

It's the single most important public health crisis - the single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetime. And I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility - and I think the F.D.A. is attempting to do so now - in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to the people who are at risk at AIDS. And I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January and I would encourage the current Administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had in this particular area. I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.

The Federal program doesn't do that, no other state programs do that, and I favor the death penalty. I know it's tough and honest people can disagree, but when a narcotics wrapped-up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.

Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.

Over the years you have expressed several positions while opposing nearly all forms of government payment for it.

Certainly the evidence is compelling. There's an explosion of single-parent families. And by any measure these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school dropouts, crime which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control.

And no popular songwriting team cast a larger spell over its generation than John Lennon and Paul McCartney, whose musical collaboration gave the 1960's the backbeat of promise. Lennon was the rock-and-roll anarchist, the low rider, the loner, the one who wore no underpants. McCartney was the musical eclectic, the hustler, the peacemaker, the partner with the melodic genius. Together as part of the Beatles, they made joy and sold society its deliriums: love, revolution, drugs, peace, mysticism. The Beatles took rock-and-roll off the entertainment page and put it in the headlines. ''We turned everything into theater,'' said Lennon, a former art student who understood the potency of imagery. The Beatles seized their moment and shaped it, riding each new wave all the way to the bank. They were ''the glass of fashion and the mould of form'' and, in their princely grandeur, the first of that newest of social phenomena - the hipoisie.",KING OF THE HIPOISIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/books/king-of-the-hipoisie.html

The police arrived on the scene with guns drawn and called for the culprit to come downstairs. When Lennon came out from hiding in the bedroom, they were flabbergasted. Finally a policeman spoke: ''Do you think the Beatles will ever get together again?'' Fame, the former Beatle knew, excused every outrage, and Lennon walked away from the melee. At the birth of his second son, Sean, in 1975, when Yoko Ono was in convulsions - according to Lennon because she had been given a transfusion of the wrong blood type - the spell of his fame was more powerful than his wife's predicament.

He repeated the sin of his father with his own first son, Julian, virtually abandoning the boy after his divorce.

Although Lennon's intentions were better with his second son, Sean, his role as househusband, like those of radical and peace activist, was purely for show.

She was shrewd and well educated and displayed a bounty hunter's will of iron. She and Lennon made wonderful photo opportunities together - stripping for the cover of their ''Two Virgins'' album, inaugurating the bed-ins for peace. She seemed to irritate everybody. Lennon mythologized their fraught love in ''The Ballad of John and Yoko,'' but he also used her to drive a wedge between the Beatles and himself, going so far as to install her in a bed at the recording studio when her back was injured during the making of their last album, ''Abbey Road.'' In later years, during Lennon's period of solitary confinement at the Dakota between 1975 and 1980, Ms. Ono toyed with the idea of turning the story of their romance into a Broadway musical for which she would write the songs and give Lennon the credit. But by then, the romantic bloom was off the rose. ''We're gonna treat him like the fungus he is,'' she is quoted as saying in Mr. Goldman's biography: keep him in the dark and feed him manure.

Mr. Goldman, the author of ''Ladies and Gentlemen - Lenny Bruce!!!'' and ''Elvis,'' has been stonewalled by Ms. Ono and by the remaining Fab Three. He has also not been allowed to quote from Lennon's songs. So his massive biography has the ring not of trenchancy but of tittle-tattle. His pages are filled with trivia and bad writing. The prose is abstruse when it strains to be hip and laughable when it tries to be matter-of-fact. Mr. Goldman and his editors should know better. He clots his tale with antique academic locutions like ''in fine,'' ''nay,'' ''wont to say.''

In ''Shiloh and Other Stories'' and her novel, ''In Country,'' she has shown a deft touch for the craft of narrative fiction and has charmed many readers with her ability to write dialogue, particularly the dialogue of country folk. Her new short novel, ''Spence + Lila,'' displays some of her strengths quite well, but also suggests she may have gone about as far as she can go with her favored techniques. One wishes she had risked a bit more in this book, taking us under the surface of things instead of lingering there so lovingly and relentlessly.",THE FAMILY AT HER BEDSIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/books/the-family-at-her-bedside.html

Their three grown children - daughters Cat and Nancy and son Lee - are in nervous attendance. Spence's memories, as he moves back and forth from the farm to the hospital room, and Lila's memories, as she daydreams or dozes through the days, provide a gloss of the history of the family. Spence and Lila emerge as simple people who have lived close to the land and possess only the most limited vocabulary with which to examine their mostly unexamined lives. The children are sketched with as few lines as possible (as they might be in a short story) -Cat, vaguely feminist, who lives in Boston; Nancy the bookworm; Lee, who left the farm for a factory job and mortgage slavery.

A few vignettes of Spence passing shells below decks in World War II, seasick and wondering what's going on; Lila's solo ventures into the world on guided tours, seeing the Pacific and so on; the neighbor Bill growing marijuana along with his corn; celebrations of the fertility of the earth; images of ecological pollution; references to rock-and-roll; the continual contrast of high-tech medicine and down-home earthiness - it all reads very easily.",THE FAMILY AT HER BEDSIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/books/the-family-at-her-bedside.html

Perhaps out of the suspicion that the author has reduced the central characters down to manageable form to fit them into the book, rather than risking the attempt to deal with fully complex characters who might represent more of a threat to the neatness of the narrative. Are simple country people really as simple as Spence and Lila suggest? (I must confess to a prejudice here. I don't think there are any simple people. Not down on the farm, not in the city, not anywhere. Some people may appear to be so, but that is the surface. We are all extraordinarily complex, it seems to me, albeit in different ways.) Miss Mason is very good at eliciting the special poignancy of people who don't really understand what is happening to them. For instance, Lila being taken up to the operating room: ''As the leprechauns wheel her away, she sees Spence gazing after her helplessly. She has forgotten to tell Nancy and Cat something, something important she meant to say about Spence. His face disappears and she is in an elevator, with music playing, the kind of music they play in heaven.''",THE FAMILY AT HER BEDSIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/26/books/the-family-at-her-bedside.html

''I'd like to see the planet get back to its normal self. The environment, the distribution of wealth. It's a bit of mess, don't you think?'' But the revival was also very much an event for 1988. The people of the Clearwater, a replica of an 18th-century river sloop, have for 22 years conducted educational programs on the effects of pollution on the river, and functioned as an environmental-advocacy group. The revival, a fund-raising event, requires many hours of work and organizational activity. These efforts are fueled by a concern for ecology that cuts across political and social and economic boundaries - or, as Brian Forist, Clearwater's education specialist, puts it, ''Clean water is no longer considered a radical idea.'' Ironically, water - clean or otherwise - was missing from this year's festivities. The Revival began in 1966 as The Hudson Valley Folk Picnic, first held in a sheep pasture in Garrison, overlooking the Hudson. The locale shifted as the festivities grew in size, until, a decade ago, it moved to Croton Point Park. This winter, however, the adjacent Croton Point Landfill was declared a hazardous waste site by the State Department of Environmental Conservation, according to John Mylod, Clearwater's executive director. This is the first year the festival has been held inland. ''We felt we couldn't invite people to the Croton site,'' Mr. Mylod said, adding that ''no other spot on the river had enough space or access from public transportation.''","THE VIEW FROM: THE GREAT HUDSON RIVER REVIVAL;

Famous dull dogs abound in literature, but even the cur in ''A Dog of Flanders'' is full of surprises compared to Alligator, the pit bull of Scott Ely's second novel. Imagine a canine Rambo with a foul smell, and you've got him. Alligator may be ''dead game'' - the sporting term for a dog who'll fight to the death - but he's also dead boring. Even so, he doesn't deserve what happens to him by the end of this book. Neither do we. Nor, maybe, does Mr. Ely, who started with some promising ingredients: a father and son bitterly divided over the loss of their family farm and how to get it back, a whole Mississippi town (from woman mayor to preacher to black school principal) involved in a scheme to recoup everyone's fortunes by raising a monster marijuana crop, and a blonde in emerald earrings, hooking her way through nursing school, who decides she'd rather be a herpetologist. The main trouble is that none of these characters is real enough to care about, one way or the other. The son wishes the father violently dead on page 7 and frequently thereafter, but by the end of the first scene it's quite clear that nothing can ever come of their sullen strife beyond tepid reconciliation. Mr. Ely's prose is laconic to the point of shorthand, and when a character gets off a halfway good line it's repeated, parrotlike, every time the character reappears. Pavlovian symbolism abounds: whenever the son's shrapnel scars itch, for example, the reader is supposed to be conditioned to think, ''Ah, yes, Viet-Vet Syndrome.''",IN SHORT: FICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/books/in-short-fiction-115888.html

Indeed, had I been a publisher, I'd be putting on my books' covers not only their authors' names but also the exact age at which they composed this or that work, in order to enable their readers to decide whether they care to reckon with the information or the views contained in a book written by a man so much younger - or, for that matter, so much older - than they are themselves.",HOW TO READ A BOOK,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/12/books/how-to-read-a-book.html

Such people normally dislike themselves far more than their detractors dislike them. Such people still prefer alcohol and tobacco to heroin or marijuana - such people are those whom, in W. H. Auden's words, ''one will not find on the barricades and who never shoot themselves or their lovers.'' If such people however occasionally find themselves swimming in their blood on the floor of prison cells or speaking from a platform, it is because they rebel against (or, more precisely, object to) - not some particular injustice - but the order of the world as a whole.

A child of epitaph and epigram, conceived indeed as a short cut to any conceivable subject matter, poetry to prose is a great disciplinarian. It teaches the latter not only the value of each word but also the mercurial mental patterns of the species, alternatives to linear composition, the knack of omitting the self-evident, emphasis on detail, the technique of anticlimax.

The truth of the matter is that poetry simply happens to be older than prose and thus has covered a greater distance. Literature started with poetry, with the song of a nomad that predates the scribblings of a settler. And although I have compared somewhere the difference between poetry and prose to that between the air force and the infantry, the suggestion that I make now has nothing to do with either hierarchy or the anthropological origins of literature. All I am trying to do is to be practical and spare your eyesight and brain cells a lot of useless printed matter. Poetry, one might say, has been invented for just this purpose - for it is synonymous with economy. What one should do, therefore, is repeat, albeit in miniature, the process that took place in our civilization in the course of two millennia. It is easier than you might think, for the body of poetry is far less voluminous than that of prose. What's more, if you are concerned mainly with contemporary literature, then your job is indeed a piece of cake. All you have to do is to arm yourselves for a couple of months with the works of poets in your mother tongue, preferably from the first half of this century.

After it was published in 1975, ''The Tao of Physics'' by Fritjof Capra inspired so many imitators that he could be said to have started a genre. By elegantly drawing parallels between the acausal, relativistic world of modern physics and the teachings of Buddhism, Mr. Capra produced an intellectual gem. What made the book so credible was that its author was trained as a physicist. But as he shows in the autobiographical ''Uncommon Wisdom,'' he was never so much a scientist as a devotee of that grab bag of countercultural magic that has come to be called new-age philosophy. It is not clear who would want to read this book, which traces the intellectual origins of Mr. Capra's thought. His tales of hitchhiking through Big Sur, smoking marijuana and discussing the novels of Hermann Hesse have a certain nostalgic charm. And his story of sharing a couple bottles of wine at breakfast with the radical psychotherapist R. D. Laing is priceless. But most of the conversations reported here - be they with Werner Heisenberg, Gregory Bateson, E. F. Schumacher or Indira Gandhi - are more tedious than enlightening.

Bush attended at least 30 meetings at which the Iranian arms sale was discussed, beginning in the summer of 1985. Moreover, Bush's staff had information that might have led them to question Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's relationship with the contras: the Vice President's national security adviser, Donald P. Gregg, a former C.I.A. station chief, was told in August 1986 that North was involved in Central America with associates of the renegade C.I.A. agent Edwin Wilson.",IN SEARCH OF GEORGE BUSH,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/magazine/in-search-of-george-bush.html

But until new sweeping strategies are developed that elevate the problem to a crucial foreign policy issue, it may not be enough, as the Reagan Administration has urged, to just say no to drugs. SOME TROUBLE SPOTS Hearings this month in Congress have drawn attention to Panama's vast links to international narcotics trafficking. And Colombia's drug barons have recently stepped up a campaign of violence and bribery. Here are some other trouble spots: MEXICO: ''Mexico is the primary single country supplier of heroin and marijuana to the United States,'' according to a State Department report in 1987. ''Moreover, about one-third of the cocaine consumed in the United States in 1986 transited Mexico.'' Traffickers have apparently corrupted some state governments. BOLIVIA: Cocaine brings an estimated $600 million a year to Bolivia, compared with $500 for all legal exports combined. Last fall, American officials said Bolivia would lose some aid because it failed to substantially reduce its coca leaf crop, the world's second largest. THE BAHAMAS: ''Continues to be a major transit country for cocaine and marijuana shipments to the United States,'' the 1987 report said. Two years ago, a commission appointed by Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling found drug corruption in his Cabinet, but cleared him of wrongdoing. PAKISTAN: One of the world's largest producers of opium. Drug barons have well-armed private armies. PERU: ''The world's largest cultivator of coca leaf,'' the 1987 report said.

Urofsky. (Adler & Adler, $24.95.) Melvin I. Urofsky, a professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University, says there never was a Supreme Court Justice so public as William O. Douglas. Douglas wrote for Playboy, addressed environmentalists' rallies and told politicians what to do. In these letters is the impatient man who had something to say about everything. Much of the collection is routine doing of business with colleagues, though some letters trace such unroutine decisions as Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade, and some contain interesting sniping. (''Earl Warren,'' Douglas wrote in 1961, ''is a cheap politico with a Christer complex.'') He also wrote to Franklin D. Roosevelt, John and Robert Kennedy, Indira Gandhi, the lawyers who handled his three divorces and the son and daughter who were trying to get away from him. Many of the letters were private until Cathleen Douglas Stone opened the files to Mr. Urofsky and his son Philip several years after her husband's death in 1980. Few are surprising, especially to anyone who has read Douglas's autobiography. But the letters tell some stories differently - his feud with Felix Frankfurter, for example, takes on a nastier cast. He reported on other enemies too, such as the ''federal agents'' in the Nixon Administration who, he told neighbors in a mysterious, offhand note, planted marijuana on his property in Washington State. And the fact that so much in this volume turned into recorded history heightens the usual pleasure in reading somebody else's mail.",NONFICTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/21/books/in-short-nonfiction-992088.html

Natalie McKelvy has taken a bit of a chance in writing a serious novel about a young couple in the midst of professional and marital failure. What reader, heartily sick of anything to which the word ''yuppie'' can be attached, can muster sympathy for characters who aspire no higher than upward mobility? But Ms. McKelvy gives a fair and sometimes compelling portrait of people whose dreams are so modest they are sure to disappoint. Gin, a teacher, has grown to dislike his job; he'd rather be a school administrator than teach inner-city kids to write. Marsh, a banker, dreams of owning a house in the suburbs and becoming a real-estate mogul. Their marriage is on the rocks, however, mostly because each thinks the other should be a success. Gin and Marsh hope to redeem themselves by getting new jobs and buying that house, and it's at this point that Ms. McKelvy best captures the keeping-up-with-the-Joneses syndrome. Trying to start all over again, Gin and Marsh fool themselves all over again. The business traveling Marsh must do to pay for the house only emphasizes the distance between her and Gin; each has an affair with a new workmate; and the result is a final battle and, perhaps, a lasting peace. ''Where's Ours?'' is a first novel that doesn't aim particularly high, but there is poignancy in the plight of its unwitting victims. The Great American Dream has failed them, and their ordinary losses become, for a time, extraordinarily bitter. As fiction, this is a quick, untaxing read; as social commentary, it's homage to the fact that there is bravery in simply holding on to what one has.","IN SHORT;
