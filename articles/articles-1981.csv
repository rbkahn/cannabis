Around the conference table in the panoramic offices of the New York State Urban Development Corporation (U.D.C.) atop 1 Astor Plaza sit half a dozen of the key state and city strategists in the latest - and by far the most ambitious and promising - campaign to transform Times Square. For months, many of the 26 hopeful developers, with their architects, lawyers and consultants in tow, trooped to the skyscraper to see the slide show and to hear James R. Hunter, the U.D.C.'s vice president for economic development, Paul A. Travis, project director of the New York City Public Development Corporation, and other officials from the City Planning Commission lay out in detail their vision of a billiondollar rebirth for the world's most famous entertainment district. The prospective developers, including companies bearing familiar names like Helmsley, Shubert, Brandt, Rockrose, and Olympia & York, went off to draft and submit their proposals. Sometime early in 1982, the joint city-state team running the privately funded 42d Street Redevelopment Project is slated to announce the winning developers - those judged to have submitted the most favorable proposals for restoring the historic theaters of 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, for renovating subway stations and for providing sparsely developed lower Times Square with the equivalent of three-fourths of a World Trade Center's worth of new office and commercial space.",A TIMES SQUARE REVIVAL?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/magazine/a-times-square-revival.html

The trend is not limited to 42d Street. Significant fringe-area developments include the $375 million convention center now going up in the West 30's; the virtually completed $226 million modernization and expansion of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, whose new ground-level shops opening onto 42d Street have eliminated some of the neighborhood's skid-row aspects; a reopened and rechristened hotel, now the Best Western-Milford Plaza Hotel, on Eighth Avenue at 44th Street; plans for a $292.5 million Portman Hotel and Broadway Mall between 45th and 47th Streets, and the reopening as legitimate theaters of two former sex-oriented movie houses.",A TIMES SQUARE REVIVAL?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/magazine/a-times-square-revival.html

They found 42d Street overwhelmingly male and racially heterogeneous (the white population has declined since then), with a clear subculture of male and female prostitutes, drug-sellers and other hustlers, all with established bits of turf. It was also possibly the most heavily traveled street in the city - some 300,000 pedestrian trips a day - and a primary drug center - during a two-month period, an estimated 12,000 transactions took place on a single block. The 17 movie theaters in the area were estimated to be grossing between $192,000 and $320,000 a week. And one out of five New Yorkers responding to the study's mail poll admitted to having patronized a Times Square adult bookstore in the previous year, and one out of 10 to having attended a peep show. Although 42d Street offended almost everyone surveyed, almost everyone also thought it was worth reclaiming for legitimate entertainment. ''For the first time,'' says Richard A. Kahan, president of New York State's Urban Development Corporation, ''we have a plan that builds on the existing strengths of 42d Street ... the original impetus - entertainment.''

The real causes are seen as the lack of business confidence in the area's future, a pattern of fragmented property ownership and the shunning of the area by the middle class. Together, these factors have thwarted major redevelopment for half a century. Consequently, the redevelopment plan now moving forward rests on three major initiatives: using the state's power of eminent domain to condemn properties for public purposes, luring builders by offering prime cleared sites for office towers, and linking redevelopment opportunities to the restoration of legitimate theaters on 42d Street.",A TIMES SQUARE REVIVAL?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/magazine/a-times-square-revival.html

One danger is souring economic conditions, which could halt a half-finished project or create vacant space for the sex industry to move into. ''There's no question that before we're done there'll be two, maybe three,recessions,'' Mr. Kahan says. ''That's the natural order of things.'' But the planning will have to look beyond these cycles, he adds. ''It may mean waiting a few extra years, but if we hold fast to our basic design principles, which I believe are sound, we will ultimately get there.'' Basically, the current plan calls for demolition of several nondescript old buildings where Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42d Street intersect. In their place would rise three or four new office towers soaring as high as 60 stories. Two main buildings would be retained: the landmark red and gray classical Knickerbocker office building on the southeast corner of Broadway and 42d Street and the 25-story former Times Tower, which gave the intersection its name when the newspaper, now located on 43d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, moved there from Park Row in 1905.

The present dissolution announcement only adds new doubt to the whole shadowy record.",IN THE LAND OF THE KHMER ROUGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/magazine/in-the-land-of-the-khmer-rouge.html

One well-to-do family lost three cars in a year, the last on a trip to buy Swiss chocolates from a fancy confectioner. The gunmen who took their car also confiscated their chocolates. The latest available figures showed 36,884 second-hand cars imported in a year, in contrast to 7,743 new ones sold to normally conspicious consumers. In Lebanon, even car theft has a special flair. As many as three-quarters of the stolen cars were said to have wound up in the hands of a well-known figure named Abu Chawki, whose protected village of Britel, in the northern Bekaa Valley, contained a sprawling parking lot. Bereft car owners from Beirut could take a numbered waiting check, go through the parking lot and, if they could properly identify their own automobile, buy it back at a reduced rate. Abu Chawki held a news conference a while ago to announce that he had made a pledge to the Moslem Mufti of Baalbek to get out of the hotcar business, but added that he had only been performing a public service, ''helping innocent citizens retrieve their property.'' The journalistic shorthand for the Lebanese conflict has been Christian right and Moslem left, roughly meaning that the former wanted to keep things the way they were and look to the West for support and the latter wanted change and got their weapons from the Soviet bloc. The reality, of course, is vastly more complex, particularly since, in the last two years, erstwhile allies on both the right and left have turned on each other.

Thousands of Palestinian guerrillas also settled in Lebanon after they were expelled by King Hussein of Jordon for threatening his throne, which led to the Black September clashes of l970. The Maronites were furious at the swaggering presence of the guerrillas, who behaved like rulers of a state within a state. The tensions between Lebanon's Christians and Moslems exploded into war in 1975. This civil war was fought with a savagery that can be engendered only by religion; there were tortures, mutilations and massacres on both sides. People were pulled from cars and killed or spared simply on the basis of the religion marked on their identity cards. At first, the Palestinians tried to stay out, but they were dragged in when the tide of battle began to shift in favor of the Christians who so disliked them.

Now there is a new Christian line commander, 21-year-old Gilbert Ghostine, who says he has been fighting off and on for seven years, lately alternating with his studies in business administration at the Jesuit St. Joseph's University a few blocks away. He hopes to have his bachelor's degree this year and go on for his master's. In his command post, decorated with representations of the Sacred Heart and photographs of the buildings across the way, there is the usual Beirut bric-a-brac, scraps of shrapnel and parts of bombs. There are 92 full-time militiamen on regular duty on the Christians' three- or four-block-long front. A city planning map on the wall, carefully marked, shows 21 buildings in a rough arch as holding enemy snipers, another nine marked as Christian positions. The strongly fortified posts are built into apartments, with family possessions pushed aside or locked in a back room for years. The families continue to live amid the barricades. Asked what it was like for people in the middle of the fighting, the young commander simply shrugs.

On this day, however, the clock was fixed before the morning traffic jam ended and well before many ships had headed downriver, weighted down by cargoes of everything from melons to electronic calculators.",THE AMAZON: A NEW SEARCH FOR EL DORADO,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/magazine/the-amazon-a-new-search-for-el-dorado.html

I'm not entirely confident that this particular irony is intended, though many others clearly are, nor am I certain that ''The Kleber Flight'' is as vivid as a work of the imagination as it is perplexing as a moral dilemma. Still, when all is done, there is reason to be glad for David Lum's existence as a literary character. And considering his dark preoccupation with death and violence, one feels fortunate to have him end up alive.

For Borges, who has been nearly blind since youth, the uncertain border between appearance and reality, the relativity of time, the suspicion that we are living in a dream are more than literary tropes: They are the crucial experiences of a life lived wholly in the imagination.

And in ''Kafka and His Precursors,'' Borges claims to have found in Aristotle, Browning, the French novelist Leon Bloy and a 9th-century Chinese writer named Han Yu ''prefigurations'' of Kafka.

When his parodies of scholarship succeed, it is because they mime the plausible: the bibliography of Menard's work that lists among his publications an ''invective against Paul Valery in the 'Journal for the Suppression of Reality'; the discussion of an epic poem by Carlos Argentino Daneri, who aspired to capture in verse the entire face of the planet and ''had already dispatched a number of acres of the state of Queensland, nearly a mile of the course run by the River Ob, a gasworks to the north of Veracruz, the leading shops in the Buenos Aires parish of Concepcion, the villa of Mariana Camdaceres de Alvear in the Belgrano section of the Argentine capital, and a Turkish baths establishment not far from the wellknown Brighton aquarium.'' But too often his fanciful scholarship is simply cute: the discovery of a lost civilization populated by transparent tigers; the glosses on obscure cabalistic scholars.

Time and again, he manages to distill in just a page or two the substance of a writer's character and work. ''The mere happy vagabond proposed by the verses of 'Leaves of Grass' would have been incapable of writing them,'' he observes of Whitman; Henry James is ''sad and labyrinthine,'' Kafka ''almost professionally unreal.'' Summing up Melville, he writes: ''Vast populations, towering cities, erroneous and clamorous publicity have conspired to make unknown great men one of America's traditions.'' And his essay on Hawthorne is one of the most evocative literary portraits I have ever read. Drawing upon the novelist's tales and journals, Borges elicits Hawthorne's loneliness and grim estrangement from the world with the sort of intuitive sympathy no critic since Lionel Trilling has achieved. ''Hawthorne never ceased to feel that the task of the writer was frivolous or, what is worse, even sinful,'' Borges writes, yet what comes through in this essay is the nearly unbearable somberness that pervades Hawthorne, his fiercely moral effort ''to make art a function of the conscience.''",A MAN OF HIS WORDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/books/a-man-of-his-words.html

It is the work that interests him - not isolated from its circumstances, as it was for the New Critics, but as a testament by one of the members of that idiosyncratic tribe who represent for Borges a simultaneous clan beyond time or geography.

This is more than the random assemblage of marginalia such anthologies often are; it collects for an American audience pieces that enhance and enlarge our sense of Borges's accomplishment. The politcal essays are especially notable, for they demonstrate a defiant opposition to Argentina's succession of fascist governments and thus temper the impression of unworldliness that clings to Borges. ''Our Inadequacies'' is a compilation of ''the Argentine citizen's most apparent defects'' that expresses open contempt for the generals who put an end to democracy there in the 1930's; and ''Portrait of the Germanophile,'' published in the midst of World War II, is a vehement denunciation of those Argentines who sympathized with the Nazis: ''The Hitlerist is always a spiteful man, and a secret and sometimes public admirer of vicious cleverness and cruelty.''

As the authors have it, their hero stole a woman, Emelia Bossano (Lisa Mordente), from Shakespeare - and never mind the other characters' conjecture that Marlowe tended to ''prefer the boys.'' According to the Playbill, ''the story of this drama is essentially true and accurate, except for minor adjustments in time for dramatic purpose.'' This may come as a surprise to some scholars, who will discover, in addition to the other ''minor adjustments,'' that the authors have changed the generally accepted location and perpetrator of Marlowe's murder.","THEATER: 'MARLOWE,' A ROCK MUSICAL",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/13/theater/theater-marlowe-a-rock-musical.html

Lennie Del Duca, Jr.'s spurned Shakespeare - ''I've sweated sonnets for you,'' he tells Miss Mordente - is so retiring and slow-witted that we always believe the authors' contention that he was the Globe's foremost nerd.","THEATER: 'MARLOWE,' A ROCK MUSICAL",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/13/theater/theater-marlowe-a-rock-musical.html

Leonard's advisers want the public to see Hearns as the challenger or - better yet -the would-be usurper. In fact, one of the things that make this fight interesting is that officially there is no champion and no challenger. In the divided world of boxing, both men hold welterweight titles: Hearns from the World Boxing Association, Leonard from the World Boxing Council. For that reason, Steward - who doesn't want his man to appear as either challenger or usurper - has insisted that the two fighters receive equal treatment. For a long time, Steward was saying that Hearns wouldn't even step into the ring with Leonard unless each fighter was guaranteed he'd leave with the same amount of money in his pocket. That was a bargaining position, of course. Steward realized that Leonard was the drawing card. All he really wanted was to avoid the kind of embarassing imbalance that occured in the first Leonard-Duran fight - when Leonard's purse was six times Duran's. But Steward, who gets 50 percent of Hearns's take, after expenses, did win two other significant c oncessions. In boxing protocol, the champion always enters the ri ng after the challenger. Steward wrote into the contractthat on Wedne sday night both men would enter the ring at the same time. And whi le half the advertisements bill the fight as the Leonard-Hearn s match, the other half bill it as Hearns-Leonard. Mike Trainer shrug s off these compromises as inconsequential.

The state radio said that one guardsman was also slain. (A1:1-2.) Future American-Chinese ties will be determined by how Washington handles the issue of Taiwan, according to Jimmy Carter's impressions of his talks with the Chinese leadership. The former President has ended a 10-day visit to China. (A2:3-6.) Britain's Labor Party is embroiled in a bitter campaign over its deputy leadership. The contest, to be settled at a party convention on Sept. 27, has major significance. Both Denis Healey, who holds the post, and Tony Benn, the challenger, view the campaign as a critical milestone for the party at a time of major realignment in British politics. (A2:3-6.) National An effort to cut welfare rolls has been devised by the Reagan Administration. The plan would require state agencies to assess most of the personal property and household effects of welfare recipients to insure that their assets do not exceed the statutory limit of $1,000 per household. (A1:6.) Inquiries into food stamp fraud carried out on a large scale are to be coordinated by a special unit of officials in the Justice Department, the Agriculture Department and the Postal Service, according to Justice Department officials. They said some Government investigators believe that $1 billion is lost through food stamp fraud each year, and that evidence of the cheating is increasing. (A6:1.) The Clean Air Act would be crippled under detailed proposals quietly drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency. An analysis of the plan suggests that, if approved by Congress, the changes would eliminate many key provisions of the law, including programs requiring stringent rules on regions with polluted air and special safeguards for areas where the air is relatively clean. (A1:1.) Unionists accorded President Reagan a polite but cool reception in his first appearance before a labor group since he dismissed 12,000 striking flight controllers. Shortly after Mr. Reagan's speech, members of the carpenters' union cheered a Democratic official when he criticized the President's economic policies and handling of the controllers' walkout. (A11:1.) Proposed cuts in military spending would jeopardize national security and send the wrong signals to the Soviet Union and America's allies, according to a statement made by Deputy Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at a meeting with Edwin Meese 3d, the Presidential counselor. (A9:1-4.) The number of abortions obtained by poor women has been little affected by the law that nearly eliminated the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, according to a Federal study. The report also said that the Congressional restriction on Federal abortion funds has not resulted in an increase of illegal abortions or in large numbers of unwanted births. (A1:5.) The Sun Belt has higher fertility rates than the rest of the country, according to the Census Bureau. An official said that women in the South and West were having the majority of births every year. (A6:2-5.) Over-the-counter drugs were assailed in a lawsuit filed by Public Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader. The suit asserts that ingredients contained in more than half of these 300,000 drugs now on the market are of doubtful safety or effectiveness. (A24:1-3.) Metropolitan The breakup of a marijuana ring was announced by the authorities, who arrested 33 suspects in raids on Long Island and offshore. The early morning raid occurred just after three tons of Colombian marijuana had been unloaded on a beach from a trawler that was later seized and found to hold 17 more tons. (A1:3-5.) The thre at of a new drought was raised by a drastically dry August after four mo nths of plentiful rainfall. Robert Goodell, operations chief of the Delaware River Basin Commission, said that New York City's three big Delaware River reservoirs were only 54 percent full compared with 63 percent a year ago. (B2:1-2.) A 47 percent water rate increase was granted to the Hackensack Water Company. The concern is New Jersey's largest water supplier and the one most prone to shortages during droughts. The record rate increase will affect 800,000 people. (B1:5-6.) A doctor was fatally shot, apparently by a legless man in a wheelchair who had been waiting outside the physician's office at the Veterans Administration hospital on First Avenue and East 24th Street in Manhattan, according to the police.

He is also determined to show that the border region is ''a third country,'' with a culture that is neither Mexican nor American - an undiscovered ''colony unto itself'' with its own customs and its own unwritten laws. It took Mr. Miller four months to drive the length of the frontier from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific coast, stopping at every official crossing, eating only in border cafes, unearthing local history and recording small-town gossip. He met prostitutes and campesinos and local politicians. What emerges is a sometimes arch, but deftly written book, concerned less with the political issues it raises than with ordinary people's lives.",Nonfiction in Brief,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nonfiction-in-brief-191350.html

In one chapter, a whimsical search for a legendary bandit's cantina leads him to a quiet working man's bar where he spends the evening drinking with factory hands. But, he too is fascinated by border outlaws: enterprising smugglers who fly televisions into the desert, raffish entertainers at a Mexican cockfight, disk jockeys who evade American law by broadcasting from across the border. Mr. Miller shows persuasively that in large part it is the border that creates these crimes, institutionalizing the gap between rich and poor and encouraging an endless variety of smuggling - of marijuana and Mexican parrots, American clothing and electronic goods - often with the help of a well-placed bribe.",Nonfiction in Brief,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nonfiction-in-brief-191350.html

They are a kind of leitmotif in Mr. Miller's rambling account: so many thousands caught each week at one bridge, a group of three beaten by Texan vigilantes, so many hundreds passing weekly through another hole in the fence. Mr. Miller writes sharply about the discrimination that is a way of life along the border. All the more unconvincing then is his optimistic conclusion ''that one day frontiers would no longer exist,'' and that without them border crime and smuggling, and even the intractable economic gap will somehow simply disappear.",Nonfiction in Brief,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/books/nonfiction-in-brief-191350.html

He is charmed by rundown Mexican hamlets and likes the people he meets in bordertown cafes. Deliberately light in tone and understated, ''On the Border'' leaves a lot of questions unanswered.

Like the thousands of scientists who came to work at the new atomic laboratory, the author is much taken up by ''a great atmosphere of excitement, a feeling ... akin to the first few days of summer camp.'' Also like Oppenheimer and many of his colleagues, Mr. Goodchild is concerned above all with the technical obstacles to building the bomb: Moral questions are largely forgotten in the face of scientific riddles and administrative headaches. Mr. Goodchild shows persuasively how wartime political pressures encouraged Oppenheimer and others to put aside whatever qualms they had. He writes poignantly about the depression that overcame many scientists after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Illegal bugging, an open search for ''a hanging jury,'' deliberate abuse of security regulations to keep evidence from Oppenheimer's counsel, dubious efforts to influence witnesses and officials who decided the case: Mr. Goodchild reveals a tangled and unseemly web of Government intrigue. He is deeply indignant on Oppenheimer's behalf, but can also write candidly about the physicist's own ambiguous actions and political beliefs.

As St. Thomas Aquinas noted, ''law is a pedagogue,'' not a referee; evidence of material injury (''damages''), the ''clear and present danger'' test, the presence of a ''consenting adult'' and so on are merely empirical distractions when it comes to determining whether a moral principle has been violated. (In an earlier book, ''Bureaucracy, the Marshall Plan, and the National Interest,'' Mr. Arkes argued that in foreign policy the national interest must not be narrowly defined by the standards of physical security.)

To defame a group, he claims, is to draw inferences about the behavior of individuals from aggregate characteristics. Group defamation is thus inherently unjust, for it denies individuals their freedom and moral autonomy. Since the capacity for moral choice is for Mr. Arkes the basis of legal responsibility, group libel is thus a wrong not because it results in material injuries or because it presents a ''clear and present danger'' but because it threatens ''the concept of morals itself.'' ''If the premises of group libel are not wrong, nothing can be wrong,'' he contends.

While Mr. Clark refers to drug addiction, high rates of violent crime, venereal disease and family breakdown as the ''pathology of the community,'' Mr. Arkes questions whether the ghetto really is the source of these ''so-called pathologies.'' And while Mr. Clark, with the ''detachment'' of the social scientist, points out the pathologies of middle-class life, Mr. Arkes thinks he should be affirming, ''in effect, the superior dignity of moral worth of that way of life which has been identified (rightly or wrongly) as 'middle class.' But that is an understanding which Mr. Clark seemed to find too embarrassing or too impolitic to admit.

Von Dohm's work offered civil rights to Prussian Jewry on disturbingly ambiguous terms. It implied that Jewry's present condition was one of ''cultural depravity'' (we would say that it was ''culturally underprivileged'') because of past prejudice, and it would soon be cured by ''civic betterment,'' which, to assimilated Jews like Moses Mendelssohn, sounded perilously close to a call for ''moral self-improvement.''

The book: ''The Last Whole Earth Catalog,'' a zestfully annotated listing of tools, services, books and other sources of inspiration and advice that refugees from urban life needed to survive as communards. Its creator/editor: Stewart Brand, an alumnus of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, who conceived it in 1968 as a catalogue for a mail-order business he ran, with the aid of six hippies, out of a warehouse in a San Francisco suburb. In many editions and under various names, his ''whole earth catalogs'' sold 2,100,000 copies and netted Mr. Brand more than $1,500,000, with which he set up a foundation to further causes close to his heart, one of them a magazine, CoEvolution Quarterly.",PAPERBACK TALK,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/books/paperback-talk.html

''Today's whole-earth people are less concerned about countering culture than in surviving,'' he says.

The Galician coastline is meandering and green -and often rain-soaked. Santander has wide, sandy beaches - but the Atlantic Ocean makes the weather uncertain there, too. Terrorist violence and political unrest have cut sharply into summer tourism next door in the Basque region, including the broad, sweeping beaches around San Sebastian. Big stretches of the Costa Brava in Catalonia and all of the Costa del Sol in the South have become high-rise discotheque jungles. The beach towns around Alicante are a package-tour paradise - and often run short of potable water in the summer.",THE QUEST FOR A SPANISH BEACH RESORT MAY END AT MOJACAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/travel/the-quest-for-a-spanish-beach-resort-may-end-at-mojacar.html

It is, in fact, the gem of the Almeria coast, which lies at the eastern flank of the towering Sierra Nevada mountain range, and it is still, relatively speaking, off the beaten track.

The landscape is harsh, with parched and domed hills covered with sagebrush and cacti - reminders that Almeria is historically, spiritually and physically close to North Africa. (Indeed, when wages were still low in Spain, multinational movie makers used Almeria as an all-purpose badlands backdrop that could evoke the American West or the Arab East - a ''Mini-Hollywood: Town of the West'' is still maintained at Tabernas, where tourists can watch simulated shoot-outs and rent horses to ride through the surrounding brown hills.

The beaches are alternately sandy and rocky, at times sheltered by cliffs; they are largely deserted, save for a few hardy campers.

Western diplomats at the United Nations said that the resolution was expected to win unanimous approval at an open meeting today. (Page A1, Column 1.) Israel sought and received advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last October about how much damage would be inflicted on a nuclear reactor with 1,000-kilogram (2,200-pound) obmbs.

They said that the large purchases and other puzzling features of Iraq's supposedly peaceful program had created fears at the agency that Baghdad might be planning to build nuclear weapons in the future. (A1:1-2.) Iran's President has disappeared and may have fled the country to escape Islamic fundamentalists who seek to force his dismissal and place him on trial, according to Teheran's revolutionary prosecutor. (A1:2-3.) National Justice Potter Stewart will retire next month after serving 23 years on the Supreme Court. The Justice, who is 66 years old and is in apparent good health, gave no reason for the unexpected announcement. The retirement of Justice Stewart, who has often cast a swing vote between ideological camps, created the first Supreme Court vacancy since 1975, as well as an opportunity for President Reagan to appoint a conservative, as he is expected to do, and perhaps a woman. (A1:6.) Continued legal aid for the poor was approved by the House, which voted to keep the Legal Services Corporation alive. However, the 245-to-137 vote cut its funding to $241 million from the present $321 million and imposed stringent curbs on its activities. (A1:5.) Hearings on an antiabortion bill ended as a wide range of medical and religious groups criticized the measure as unconstitutional, scientifically unsound and potentially damaging to the health of many women. (A16:1-3.) A vaccine for foot and mouth disease, one of the world's costliest infections of livestock, has been developed with the use of genesplicing techniques, the Agriculture Department announced. Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block said that the vaccine was both safe and effective and that its use could save billions of dollars a year and increase world meat supplies. (A1:4.) The threat of an air controllers' strike starting Monday prompted the White House to reinforce warnings that the Government would take stern legal action against ''an illegal strike.'' Meanwhile, a Federal judge rejected a motion by the air traffic controllers union to set aside an injunction issued against walkouts by the union that led to a $100,000 fine in 1978. (A12:1.) The case against a missile officer was broadened by the Air Force. It accused the officer, 2d Lieut. Christopher Cooke, of making contact with Soviet officials 13 times within a year and passing military information to unauthorized persons. (A12:1-2.) Marijuana use and a fatal Navy crash were linked, the Navy acknowledged. It said that six of the 14 men killed when a jet struck the deck of the carrier Nimitz had smoked the drug. But it said that drug use had not caused the accident and that none of the users were members of the flight crew. The Navy said that the crash apparently resulted from pilot error. (A12:1.) The sweeping population shifts of the 1970's are continuing and are creating broad disparities between Congressional districts in both growth and character throughout the South and the West, the nation's fastest-growing regions. (A12:3-6.) Metropolitan Redress for missing checkroom items was narrowly set by New York State's highest court. In a 6-to-1 ruling, the Court of Appeals held that unless a restaurant formally exacted a fee, not simply accepted a voluntary tip, for checking services, a restaurateur does not have to pay more than $75 for a lost coat or other item. The limit, set by law in 1924, does not apply to theft by a restaurant owner or employees. (A1:4-6.) A new Abscam indictment was issued by a Federal grand jury. Mayor Angelo J. Errichetti of Camden, N.J., who was convicted in another Abscam case, and Kenneth N. MacDonald, a former vice chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, were charged with conspiracy and extortion for allegedly taking a total of $125,000 in illegal payments from undercover Government agents. (B2:6.) A Westchester garbage disposal plan has been devised after an eightyear effort. The county signed an agreement with a private company to convert the refuse of 34 municipalities into low-cost electricity at a projected $165 million plant in Peekskill. (B2:1-2.) An accord on transit police work rules cleared the way for New York City to add 500 officers to subway and bus patrols in the next year. Mayor Koch had pressed for state legislation to give officials more flexibility to assign personnel to shifts during high-crime hours. A compromise was worked out between the city and the State Senate, ending a point of contention that had stalled passage of the city budget. (B1:5-6.) New Jersey's gubernatorial primaries on June 2 cost the taxpayers at least $6.3 million, according to reports filed in Trenton. Besides televison commercials, the money that went to most of the 21 candidates was spent on such items as car repairs and helium for advertising balloons.

Aurelio Padron, as the hero, and Yamil Borges, as his fair Mariana, are both ingenuous young performers with sturdy voices. Among the prostitutes, there is an uncommonly promising singer-dancer named Vanessa Bell, as well as the lovely Starr Danias, a Joffrey dancer who is asked to bump and grind like a cheap stripper in her theatrical debut. One also finds the jovial Keith Jochim, who survived last winter's catastrophic ''Frankenstein'' (in which he played the Creature) only to land the role of a bumbling cop in ''El Bravo.'' It just goes to show that, in the theater at least, there isn't always nowhere to go but up.

In contrast, 10 percent of a ''control'' group not subjected to the training was smoking by the end of the year, and 19 percent after 21 months.","Ideas and Trends; OF SMOKING, CHILDREN AND A DEEP BELIEF IN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-of-smoking-children-and-a-deep-belief-in.html

Most statistics show that girls, while they generally do not smoke as much as boys, have not responded as well as boys to the antismoking blandishments. In fact, according to the National Institute of Education study, 17-and 18-year-old girls were more likely in 1979 (26 percent), than boys (19 percent), to be regular smokers. ''It's part of the general women's liberation trend,'' Dr. Maccoby suggested. ''With women behaving more like men, they are picking up bad habits too.''","Ideas and Trends; OF SMOKING, CHILDREN AND A DEEP BELIEF IN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-of-smoking-children-and-a-deep-belief-in.html

The programs have worked best among highly motivated middle-class children. ''If there has been a drop in smoking, it has been among those with more self-esteem,'' said Dr. Richard Evans, a pioneer in peer-pressure techniques at the Baylor College of Medicine.","Ideas and Trends; OF SMOKING, CHILDREN AND A DEEP BELIEF IN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-of-smoking-children-and-a-deep-belief-in.html

Dr. Richard Jessor, a social psychologist at Colorado's Behavioral Sciences Institute, has been studying changing attitudes toward alcohol and marijuana use, sex, smoking and other behavior. ''There is a change in the social support system for these things,'' he said. ''There is now a social context that is not only less accepting of cigarette smoking but objects to it. The question is whether this has penetrated to the young.''","Ideas and Trends; OF SMOKING, CHILDREN AND A DEEP BELIEF IN",https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-of-smoking-children-and-a-deep-belief-in.html

The President's decision, which was announced to the Cabinet in a closed session, also had the effect of lifting President Carter's ban on shipments of phosphate fertilizers to the Soviet Union. (Page 1, Column 6.) The Soviet Union was accused of being ''the greatest source of international insecurity'' by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in his first public speech since taking office. In outlining the philosophy behind the Reagan Administration's ''new direction'' in foreign policy, Mr. Haig said, ''Let us be plain about it: Soviet promotion of violence as the instrument of change constitutes the greatest danger to the world.''

A hearing is expected as early as next week. (1:5-6.) Measles may be eliminated in the United States by the end of 1982, except for imported cases, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control. The prediction was based on a dramatic decline in the number of cases reported in the first 14 weeks of this year as against the comparable period in 1980. (1:1.) Spiro T. Agnew admitted to his lawyer in 1973 that he had accepted kickbacks from Maryland contractors, the lawyer has testified. The lawyer, George W. White Jr., testifying in a civil damage suit to recover for the state $298,110, said that the former Vice President said that he had taken the kickbacks because such bribery had been ''going on for 1,000 years.'' (7:1-2.) Bowing to criticism that his hearings on an anti-abortion bill were ''stacked'' in favor of the legislation, Senator John P. East of North Carolina, a Senate subcommittee chairman who strongly opposes abortion, promised to extend the hearings to hear ''all points of view.'' (7:1-6.)

Denton, endorsing a view held by several witnesses appearing before a Senate subcommittee on security and terrorism in the opening day of its hearing. (10:1-2.) Metropolitan New York City's largest pension system, which assumes that women live three years longer than men, illegally discriminates against women employees by requiring them to pay higher contributions and paying them lower monthly benefits upon retirement, Judge Mary Johnson Lowe of Federal District Court in Manhattan has ruled. (1:3-4.) A freeze has badly damaged the apple crop in New York State, the second largest producer in the nation. Growing areas have reported substantial injury to crops because of three days of freezing temperatures. The eventual result is expected to be higher prices for consumers. Some experts, while acknowledging that there had been heavy damage to the blossom buds on trees, said they could not accurately estimate the extent of the damage until the apples began to grow in June. (1:2-4.) Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr. maintained under hostile questioning at his Abscam bribery trial that he had neither said nor implied to undercover agents that he would get Government contracts for a titanium mine in which he had accepted stock. (1:1.) Cases of child labor as well as violations of minimum-wage and overtime laws were found in a monthlong inquiry by Federal investigators in New York's garment industry, primarily in Chinatown, Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan has announced. Critics, noting that the Labor Department plans to reduce the number of employees in the New York regional office of the wage-and-hour division, challenged the effectiveness of such investigations in preventing such exploitation. (25:6.) A plan to establish the first statewide teacher licensing tests by Sept. 2, 1984 was approved by the New York State Board of Regents by an 8 to 3 vote. However, the plan is contingent on approval by the State Legislature, which is not certain. New York City and Buffalo already have such tests for their school systems and they will not be affected by the plan. (26:6.) A gunman threatened a candidate for Governor of New Jersey during a campaign stop at a hospital in East Orange, N.J., but was chased away by a security guard and escaped without firing any shots. The candidate, State Senator James H. Wallwork, Republican of Short Hills, was not hurt by the gunman, who was disguised in doctor's surgical garb and mask. (26:1-2.) Manhattan office workers buy drugs -mostly marijuana at a dollar a cigarette - every workday from dealers who have learned to serve what police consider to be a growing market. The sellers favor officetower plazas, doorways and vacant lots as they wait for their regular customers and for first-time clients.

A dope smoker, he decided on the marijuana issue. With a little, and then a lot, of financial help from Playboy's Hugh Hefner, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, NORML, was born in 1971.

He once managed to get himself arrested for drug possession on a speaking trip in Canada. When he went back later to defend himself, he got a lot of good publicity and a light fine, and then was arrested again en route to his plane back to the States. Mr. Stroup was also sympathetic to drug smugglers, especially if they gave NORML financial help. His attitude toward smuggling, in fact, was consistent with his vision of a world in which dope was cheap and legal. In a twist on Eugene Debs's maxim about his not being free while a single soul was in prison, Mr. Stroup believed that no marijuana smoker was truly free if a smuggler could be arrested.",DEDICATED TO DOPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/dedicated-to-dope.html

(Or seemed to. Dr. Bourne denied that he actually used the stuff, even though Mr. Anderson reports that he took a spoon being passed around the room.) Later, when Mr. Stroup's anger at the Carter Administration's lack of sympathy for oppressed drug users got the better of him, he leaked the story to the press. Dr. Bourne went down, but Mr. Stroup eventually went down with him. His allies in the drug-legalization movement could not forgive him for violating the code of not informing on another user. And Mr. Stroup's action also helped destroy what was left of the relationship he had built with the Carter Administration.

In a sense, the issue exemplified the cultural contradictions of Mr. Carter's politics. He could see that the penalties for marijuana use seemed vastly out of proportion to the dangers involved. Whatever one thinks of marijuana, it seems clear from Mr. Anderson's reporting that a lot of people have suffered under the remarkably onerous penalties many states have imposed for marijuana possession. And Mr. Carter saw as well that a large youth constituency might be sympathetic to a Presidential candidate who supported decriminalization.

So he was never really enthusiastic about the drug issue and did not do too much about it in office. And he eventually came under pressure from the other side, with groups such as Families in Action organizing an anti-pot lobby as intense in its fears as NORML was in its hopes. Like the country he led, Mr. Carter was caught in the middle of a cultural war between traditionalists who saw their values being trampled and the tramplers who believed they were struggling for freedom. (On the whole, the efforts of Mr. Stroup and his allies have been a success: in less than a decade, 11 states have decriminalized marijuana possession, and in all but two of the remaining states, it has been reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor.)

Kilpatrick - are willing to admit: that Mr. Stroup's private war was fundamentally about personal liberty.

These stories seem very much of their period: hip-urban-Jewish in sensibility, full of casual violence, nerve-scraping New York encounters and trivialized or debased sex, late-modernist in their fragmented plot-refusing structures, and excessively literary in their inspiration. What is most interesting about them is a stylistic quality, a mode of phrasing that seems perfectly contemporary while at the same time echoing - in its wry, unexpected and slightly skewed locutions - the voice of a chiding Jewish parent in the background. Though obviously the work of a bright and talented writer, many of the stories seem to have dated rather badly; their substance is too thin, their mode too nervously self-conscious, for them to have withstood successfully the erosion of certain attitudes and literary mannerisms that we associate with the late 1960's.",MEN TALKING ABOUT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/men-talking-about-women.html

I do not mean this comment disparagingly or condescendingly; ''The Men's Club,'' for all its accessibility, strikes me as decidedly superior in literary terms to the earlier stories. It is in fact based upon - and expanded from - a short story of the same title that appeared in Esquire in 1978, a story that has been converted, with a few minor stylistic changes, into the first chapter of the novel. Part of the book's appeal will no doubt stem from its extreme topicality, for ''The Men's Club'' might at first glance seem to be part of an anti-feminist backlash, to draw its energies from male fantasies of revenge against the whole monstrous regiment of women. As an ostensible cri de coeur from a small herd of male chauvinist pigs, it will thrive upon the outrage it provokes and the rueful yearnings it indulges.

'' The stories of their lives turn out to be mostly anecdotes or vignettes involving the women in their lives: wives, ex-wives, casual pickups at the supermarket, old girlfriends. These love stories, as Cavanaugh calls them, are invariably melancholy, based as they are upon lost connections, incompatible longings and lacerating fights. They are also funny at times, ruefully so. While there is much sex, there is apparently little gratification. Only the great-bodied Cavanaugh seems to have powerful desires, and even he, who will sometimes drive for 20 hours to Denver for the sake of sex (having told his wife that he has gone to the Snake River to fish) emerges as a man more driven, so to speak, than gratified.

It would be too easy to dismiss the characters, male and female, as a bunch of narcissistic, infantile, orally fixated losers. There is more to them than that.

Male bonding, ''The Men's Club'' implies, is nowadays hardly more than a swaggering attempt to assert independence from the omnipresent wife-mother. The swaggering soon enough subsides into sentimentality and bathos. Though Mr. Michaels, through his narrator, may strike some readers as too indulgent of his jolly good fellows, the lost and fatuous quality of their lives, revealed in the light of dawn, is bleakly clear. One wonders if the women at Nancy's meeting have more successfully escaped an existence of loose ends. Contradictory desires, unmet needs: the predicament in which the characters find themselves is widespread, by no means restricted to those who live along the San Andreas fault.",MEN TALKING ABOUT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/men-talking-about-women.html

Since the original short story contains in essence all the themes of the novel, the expansion runs a danger of repetitiveness, which Mr. Michaels for the most part avoids by providing some good new stories for the men to tell and by building up the antagonisms and roughhousing that accompany the sentiments of male solidarity. He also introduces an element of suspense. As the night dwindles into the small hours and the male antagonisms, fed by all that zinfandel, seek wilder and more destructive outlets, a question begins to loom: What is going to happen when Nancy Kramer comes home? As to that, I will say only that the reader will not be disappointed; the climax, when it comes, is fitting, horrific and wonderfully droll.",MEN TALKING ABOUT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/men-talking-about-women.html

Only three of its characters are developed enough to be in any way memorable; the narrator in particular remains ghostly, his profession and participation never made credible. Toward the end, the satire of California encountergroup jargon becomes too broad (''I feel you're feeling anger. ... What do you feel about that?'') and blunts the wittiness that elsewhere prevails. But such weaknesses inflict little damage. ''The Men's Club'' is excellent comedy with a mouth-puckering aftertaste, a book for head-shaking and long sighs of recognition as well as laughter. Its style is full of small verbal surprises that match the glancing quality of its insights. Evidently the shifting of his fictional scene from New York to the Bay Area has been good for Mr. Michaels's art. There is a new expansiveness, an ease, in the writing of ''The Men's Club'' that distinguishes it from the rather twitchy and abrasive quality of the short stories. Though the characters are mostly deracinated Jews living a long way from Brooklyn, faint traces of a Yiddish-English background can still be heard in some of the inversions of their speech (''Many things about this woman I admired ...''). The literary influences so evident in the stories have now been largely assimilated.

The report said that the two sides had agreed that the preservation of Communism in one country concerned all Communist nations. Western analysts viewed the unexpected meeting as a new warning to Warsaw's leadership that it must resolve economic turmoil in Poland quickly. (Page A1, Column 1.) Fears of a rightist coup in El Salvador were raised as a military leader denounced any negotiations between the governing junta and the leftist insurgents. Sources close to President Jose Napoleon Duarte said that a trip to West Germany he had planned for the weekend had been canceled, apparently because of fear of a coup.

National A huge spurt in military spending that would ''quickly strengthen our ability to respond to the Soviet threat at all levels of conflict'' was proposed by Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger. In Congressional testimony, he requested an increase in authorized financing in the present fiscal year to $178 billion, from $171.2 billion, and in the next fiscal year to $222.2 billion, from $196.4 billion. (A1:6.) The first key economic victory in Congress for President Reagan occurred as the Senate Agriculture Committee approved, by a vote of 14 to 2, a temporary freeze in the level of dairy price supports.

He even looks phlegmatic. He stands a burly 5 feet 11 inches and, at the age of 49, his appetite for good food, wine and the Pilsener beer of his homeland tends to push his weight past his desired 170 pounds. He has thick, curly dark hair and a strongly modeled face in which lines and pouches are beginning to form. His expression is likely to be one of wary amiability.

They never saw each other or their children again. Both died in extermination camps in the 1940's. Milos and his brothers were raised by an uncle and in foster homes. Forman discussed the death of his parents reluctantly and vaguely. One or both of them, he said, may have been part Jewish. Then again, they may not have been.

During those years of Karl Theodor von Sulzbach's rule as Elector Palatine, the Mannheim court orchestra was famous throughout Europe for its unprecedented virtuosity and brilliance. While it may not be historically correct to say that the modern symphony orchestra was actually born in mid-18th-century Mannheim, that city was the scene of extraordinary changes in orchestral technique and compositional styles, developments that were to affect the course of musical history. Despite the importance of the music written for the Mannheim court orchestra, little of it is actually played today in live concert. As with so much neglected repertory these days, recordings come to the rescue, in this case a boxed set called ''The Mannheim School'' featuring the Camerata Bern (Archiv 2723 068, three disks).",RESCUING THE MANNHEIM MUSIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/arts/rescuing-the-mannheim-music.html

Musically, most of the foundations were laid by the Bohemian violinist and composer Johann Stamitz (1717-1757), who came to Mannheim in 1743 and quickly put into practice his many revolutionary concepts of orchestral playing.",RESCUING THE MANNHEIM MUSIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/arts/rescuing-the-mannheim-music.html

In the Baroque era, the dynamic levels were generally terraced, that is, either loud or soft with no gradations in between. Under Stamitz, the Mannheim orchestra explored the expressive possibilities of the gradual growing crescendo - a device used previously in Baroque vocal music but not with a group of instruments. Stamitz also freed the wind players from a subservient role, added clarinets to the ensemble and began to phase out the harpsichord continuo. The symphony orchestra as we know it was beginning to take shape, and composers responded by writing in a style that would make full use of these developments.",RESCUING THE MANNHEIM MUSIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/arts/rescuing-the-mannheim-music.html

The first breakthrough in understanding the threatening physiological effects of pressure - such as narcosis and nausea - came with the publication of Paul Bert's seminal ''La Pression Barometrique'' in 1878. Today, medical researchers both here and abroad are actively conducting experiments with human subjects in high-pressure chambers. In the United States alone, there are at least four chamber complexes doing experimental hyperbaric research on humans, with another currently under construction. This wealth of research, however, is decidedly not science simply for the sake of science. The offshore oil-drilling industry, for instance, requires the constant service of commercial divers who can move freely about the ocean bottom, to assist during construction and to undertake inspection, maintenance and repair work during drilling operations. Today, offshore wells account for almost onethird of the world's oil production, and it is estimated that by the end of the decade the figure will approach 50 percent. The key to this increase will be drilling in deeper water, extending the range of underwater technicians from today's 1,000-foot limit down to perhaps 2,000 to 2,500 feet - an increase that would expand by 4 percent the amount of accessible sea floor. But first, divers have to be able to reach those depths unaided by pressurized diving bells or deep-water submarines and perform useful work - something that cannot be accomplished without dealing with the dangerous physiological effects of the greatly increased pressure on the human body.",LIFE IN AN OCEAN PRESSURE COOKER,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/magazine/life-in-an-ocean-pressure-cooker.html

What happened to blur the boundaries between childhood and adulthood? What became of childhood innocence?

Beyond the extravagances of show business looms a population of normal children, once clearly distinguishable as little boys and girls, who now look and act like little grown-ups. Lolita arrived in 1956 with a shocking impact precisely because she was only 12, and still in need of special protection. It is ironic that today, as we face a new era when innocence seems an atavistic relic, the playwright Edward Albee has cast a 24-year-old, Blanche Baker, as Lolita. Though he auditioned hundreds of children and teen-agers in cities throughout America, Albee explains: ''I was appalled by the kids I saw auditioning for the part. I could see they were being pushed by their ambitious parents. And I was worried about the psychic damage playing such a role might cause to a child.'' And yet a 13-year-old who did audition seemed hardly a vulnerable innocent when she said: ''I wouldn't mind the sex scenes. The book's about this young girl who has this thing for an older man - but I'm not sure whether it's the girl who seduces the man or the other way around.'' Nabokov did not invent childhood sophistication. As the historian Philippe Aries has pointed out in his influential study ''Centuries of Childhood,'' the very notion of innocent childhood as a separate phase of life did not exist until well after the end of the Middle Ages. During the 13th, 14th or 15th centuries, in fact, there were no special clothes or books or games for children, and by the ages of 7 or 8 (once children ceased to function as ''cognitive aliens,'' in Jean Piaget's terminology, and acquired some of the mental patterns that characterize adult thinking) children of all classes were incorporated completely into the adult world - to work and play alongside adults without special protection.",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

The pastimes that filled adult leisure in the medieval era were similarly suited for sharing with children: Tag and blindman's buff were once played outdoors by adults as well as children; indoors, adults sang songs and told stories like the tales collected by the brothers Grimm. Adults were undoubtedly more childlike in the simpler society of the past. As we learn in Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie's study of 14th-century life, ''Montaillou,'' adults then possessed far simpler concepts of time, space and history than they do today and seemed to function on a less complicated emotional level, characterized by a greater readiness to laugh and weep. At the same time, children in this close-knit world were less childlike.

The Age of Innocence began with the thinking of Locke in the 17th century, and found its major inspiration in the writings of Rousseau in the 18th. After centuries of indifference to children and their special needs, now adults began to take an intense interest in children's physical and psychological well-being. More sentimental relations and greater intimacy within the family resulted.

A more complex and newly industrialized society kept middle-class children out of the work force and required them to develop new skills and disciplines. (Children of the poor, however, were often cruelly exploited in that ''golden age.'') Now, as children began to spend greater parts of their time in schools, isolated from the adult world, their behavior inevitably began to reflect more truly their developmental stages - to seem more ''childlike.'' It was Freud who rang the death knell for that childlike child. His ideas on child sexuality filtered down to all levels of society; the child was revealed and gradually understood as a creature of seething passions and sexual desires not so very different from those of adults.",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

For while children's books of the last two centuries may have dwelt on Lambs Frolicking and Our Friend the Policeman, publications for children in early Colonial days did not shelter young readers from the realities of life. A popular 17th-century children's book, ''Youth's Divine Pastime,'' included a poem about Sodom and Gomorrah that did not mince words: Yet when his daughters tempted him To drink wine to excess He fell into that odious vice And crime of drunkenness Which caused him likewise to commit That great and heinous sin Of incest with his daughters who Were both with child by him. A woodcut illustrating this verse depicts Lot reclining lecherously on a couch while his naked daughters ply him with wine. Today, three centuries later, grim reality has returned to children's books. Once upon a time, in the Age of Innocence, children really believed that all adults were good, that all Presidents were as honest as Abe Lincoln, that the adult world was in every way bigger and better than their own world, one which children knew well was full of savagery and danger. Children were expected to give up their seats in public conveyances to adults, to reserve strong language for the company of their peers and in every way to treat adults with respect.

As Al Feldstein, editor of Mad for the past 25 years, says, ''What we did was to take the absurdities of the adult world that youngsters were facing and show kids that the adult world is not omnipotent, that their parents were telling the kids to be honest, not to lie, and yet they were cheating on their income tax.

I was lucky to get home alive.'' The phrase ''my idiot father'' does not have a jarring sound in 1981; children today are cheerfully irreverent toward their elders. But the words were shocking then, coming from a child. A convention was coming to an end - one that compelled children to repress their natural (Freud would say Oedipal) hostilities, forced them to mutter under their breaths perhaps, but rarely to be openly abusive. Mad Magazine was clearly influential in the move toward free expression among children; its relentless exposure of parental hypocricies during the 1960's caused shock waves of admiration and reaction among its young readers, who were not unaware of their older siblings' angry accusations of hypocrisy against The Great Society's war in Vietnam.",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

Unsurprisingly, the industry exercised the latter option.

In 1974 when ''The Exorcist'' opened in Washington, with an R rating, a newspaper critic commented on the number of children, many as young as 6 and 8, who had been brought by their parents or who had managed to get an adult in line to ''take me in.''

Now, as children began to be influenced by their regular viewing of ''adult movies,'' society was forced to confront the implications of the change: Some of the lines of demarcation between childhood and adulthood were being permanently removed and children were beginning to look, talk and behave in ways that no longer seemed very childlike. For during the years when movies contained innocent material, adults continued to know those things that the movies were not allowed to mention, continued to behave in those ways that movies were not allowed to portray. But children did not know those things. Now everybody knows. Countless children over 12 today have seen ''Fame,'' which deals openly with teen-age homosexual and heterosexual behavior, or ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' which painfully reveals modern patterns of parental abandonment, or ''All That Jazz'' or scores of other movies dealing with complex adult matters. Short of a radical change in current child-rearing practices, American children will continue to be exposed by the movies to increasingly mature materials. Long after children stopped believing in fairies and Santa Claus, adults continued to believe in the enduring myth of the Golden Age of Innocence. Nonetheless, children learn the ways of the adult world today not only through books, magazines, movies and television but also in their own families and homes. The formerly closed door between childhood and adulthood has been pushed ajar, and sometimes entirely removed from its hinges. ''As a little girl I had very little idea of what went on in the adult world or how grown-ups felt; they were just these remote people,'' recalls a woman who is raising two daughters in a singleparent home. ''Now my kids know huge amounts about every aspect of my life - emotional, physical, even sexual. How can I keep it from them? The first time a man slept over, after the divorce, I was nervous about the children's reactions. I got up early, closed the bedroom door and went into the kitchen to make breakfast. My 8-year-old came in as I was busy making pancakes.

But it is a fact that, without day-long supervision by a parent, the child will develop ways of coping with the vicissitudes of life that resemble similar strategies adults develop in the course of their experiences in a harsh world. The situation is not unlike that of the preliberation wife and mother who stayed in the protected confines of the home all day and seemed to retain a somewhat more childlike and innocent image, while her husband, in comparison, seemed manifestly more worldly, sophisticated and, ultimately, adult as a result of his experiences in the unprotected world.",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

Daniele Lassner, director of admissions of the Ramaz School, a New York preparatory school that combines an academic schedule with a rigorous Jewish curriculum, says an increasing number of nonreligious parents are choosing Ramaz these days: ''Parents are afraid of their kids' facing drugs and early sexuality. They feel it's a dangerous world and they hope that somehow we might protect their children from what's out there.

A mother whose 12-year-old son was suspended from school after being caught smoking marijuana in the lavatory, describes her desperate tactics to persuade him to stay away from illegal drugs: ''I told Phillip graphically what might happen if he were arrested and had to spend the night at Spofford (a juvenile detention facility).

Annie Hermann, an early-childhood expert, is distressed by current trends that advocate sharing information about adult inadequacies with children. ''We want our children to know very soon that adults are not as wonderful as they think,'' she says. ''We feel it is unfair, undemocratic somehow, to let children have false illusions about adult omnipotence. So, instead of the child believing that parents can do everything, that adults will always come to the rescue in time of need, we tell our children: 'Oh, we're just like you. We have faults and weaknesses.' But the child has his own timetable and is often not developed enough to absorb the realities of adult life when they are foisted on him prematurely. The child needs to feel dependent on the adult, has a right to this feeling. If the adult is just like the child, after all, then the child can't really depend on him. And yet that stage of childhood when children believe in parental omnipotence helps develop a basic, life-giving trust in children, a trust that carries with it half of life's enjoyment.''",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

Neubauer, director of the Child Development Center in New York, sounds another warning that reverberates with particular resonance in a time of increasing narcissism: ''Children who are pushed into adult experience do not become precociously mature. On the contrary, they cling to childhood longer, perhaps all their lives.'' Nevertheless, Dr. Neubauer is sanguine about the present state of childhood, especially when compared with other eras of the past. ''We cannot reverse the processes that have begun, the changes in the family, or woman's liberation. And we mustn't idealize children's happiness in the past. Remember the struggle for existence, the high infant mortality, child labor. Remember that a real understanding of how children behave didn't exist before the 20th century.

Kernberg, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Westchester division, brings the discussion full circle when she suggests that the new, more adult-centered conception of children today may once again allow children to become important contributors to the society they live in, not, as in the Middle Ages, because of their economic value, but because they can serve an increasingly valuable psychological function. ''I think the potential of children has been greatly underrated,'' Dr. Kernberg asserts. ''Children can participate in family matters to a far greater extent than people believed in the past. To share problems with children does not necessarily mean to unload. I feel that children can understand that parents have problems of their own, even serious ones such as mental illness. If the child is told things in language he can understand, by an empathetic adult, he can share many problems that were once hidden from children. A child needs to know that he can do something, at least to listen to a parent's problem. People forget that children are very resilient, and that they're potentially good pals.'' It has become fashionable to idealize the distant past, to suppose that since children were once integrated into adult society they were therefore better off somehow. Yet critics of the current medieval nostalgia point out evidence of widespread sexual exploitation of children, child neglect and psychological damage to children in the medieval period. Similarly, as we make the transition from an era of separation and protection of children to one in which children are once again incorporated early into a less-differentiated society, we cannot fail to observe that child abuse, child neglect, child exploitation are again on the rise, and that the lives of great numbers of children have become more difficult. Today, parents often forget that, despite the end of the Age of Innocence, some children remain vulnerable longer than others. In avoiding the past excesses of secrecy and overprotectiveness, adults in our society often abdicate their responsibilities for dealing with children's special needs.",WHAT BECAME OF CHILDHOOD INNOCENCE?,https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/magazine/what-became-of-childhood-innocence.html

He has ''added essays which I have written occasionally on episodes in my life and on some troubled places in the world where I have found myself involved for no good reason.''

Furthermore, ''Ways of Escape'' is decorated with striking physical descriptions of the many corners of the world to which Mr. Greene escaped.

Of course not, although amateur Freudians will have a merry romp through some of the material he provides. What we get instead of the mechanics of Mr. Greene's personality is a picture of the novelist, or rather Graham Greene's idea of such a picture. What is that idea? According to his fascinating, if slightly horrible, description of the way novelists tend to become ''encrusted'' with the characters they write about: an image that suits novelists well is the one Mr. Greene once heard from a taxi driver in the Caribbean, who described a body he had seen lifted from the sea. ''You couldn't tell it was a man's body because of all the lampreys which came up with it.'' If that is a fair image of a novelist, it is apt to apply it to this autobiography.

But the passionate chronologist has done more: Unable wholly to secularize his faith in this apparently predestined institution, Mr. Heckscher has provided a tale of the relationship of a tribe to its god reminiscent of the Old Testament. The author, like the clerics who guided the school, sees its progress in quasi-mythic terms. An early director hardly suspects that ''amid the human failings of himself and his colleagues, some large force was actually at work.'' Fire threatens to wipe out the fledgling community, but the indomitable rector, Henry Augustus Coit, refuses to buckle, standing tall ''as one who himself had come through the fire, whose spirit the flames had not touched.'' A later conflagration, however, turns out to be ''The Fire Within,'' signifying the spiritual turmoil to come.

One rector tries to ban automobiles from the campus, and gives a Vanderbilt the cold shoulder; the trustees bridle at building a gym for fear of mollycoddling the young Spartans.
