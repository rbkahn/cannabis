Now, over a meal at a Flushing, Queens, restaurant, Mr. DeGregorio described the tense life of an undercover cop. In the process, he mentioned his teen-age daughter, then in a drug treatment program. Mr. Blumenthal was immediately intrigued. Here was a police officer who was devoted to exposing drug traffickers and whose own daughter had become involved with drugs. What's more, Mr. DeGregorio had caught her selling them. Mr. Blumenthal quickly lost interest in his article about undercover work. It was the story of the narcotics cop and his drug-selling daughter that he wanted to tell. Mr. DeGregorio agreed to cooperate.

Bob happens to be an old friend of Catherine Mansure, the beautiful but emotionally repressed wife of Rick Mansure, a former 60's radical who is heir to his family's vast tracts of land. Catherine considers Bob's literary work a violation of her faithful marriage to Rick, almost an act of trespass on it. Thus begins Mr. Roper's homage to ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" now set in the late 1980's on an estate in the Santa Cruz mountains. After Rick comes down with a paralyzing illness, Catherine finds herself drawn not to Bob Stein but to Henry Bascomb, a secretive marijuana grower who has been a quiet trespasser on the Mansure lands. Veering from the neurotic to the erotic, Mr. Roper, whose previous books include ""Mexico Days"" and ""On Spider Creek,"" tells us in somewhat stifling detail what his characters think and fear about the inevitable affair, which, despite moments of passion, tends to make matters worse for everyone. Mr. Roper eventually reveals that Bob's latest novel, ""The Poacher,"" which features the violent but happy seduction of a thinly fictionalized Catherine by a thinly fictionalized Bob, has become the author's first best seller.

Karl Armstrong had entered the university on an R.O.T.C. scholarship, but he soon joined the huge cast of countercultural rebels in their Mifflin Street parties and ritualized bouts with police.

Sir Georg Solti is nestled in lingerie. Neville Marriner is surrounded by flasks of perfume. Here and there are even a few posters of Herbert von Karajan, whose portrait once dominated the festival. Before his death in 1989 -- he was sometimes called the ""uncrowned king"" of Salzburg -- Karajan helped turn this festival into one of the major trade fairs for the European music business and a cultural watering hole for the patrician elite willing to pay high prices to witness the festival's meticulously produced concerts, operas and plays.","Critic's Notebook; Salzburg, a Festival in Transition Without the Karajan Mystique",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-salzburg-a-festival-in-transition-without-the-karajan-mystique.html

On Saturday night, at one of the town's main plazas, hundreds of men in loden suits and women in dirndls, all holding candles, liltingly swayed and dipped and circled each other in a display of traditional Austrian folk dancing. And yesterday evening, outdoors in the Domplatz, in front of the town's largest cathedral, Hugo von Hofmannstahl's reworking of the medieval morality play ""Everyman"" was performed, as usual; Hofmannstahl, a founder of the festival, intended this play, with its message of repentance and reflection, to be a festival centerpiece, making Austrian religion part of the religion of Austrian art.","Critic's Notebook; Salzburg, a Festival in Transition Without the Karajan Mystique",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-salzburg-a-festival-in-transition-without-the-karajan-mystique.html

This year, for the first time since Karajan's death, the festival is in completely new hands. Its intendant is Gerard A. Mortier, formerly general director of the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. Karajan was born in Salzburg and lived nearby; Mr. Mortier is Belgian. Karajan was a cultural and musical conservative who devoted his energies to calculated and virtuosic performances of the mainstream repertory; Mr. Mortier made his reputation with adventursome operatic and cultural programming. Karajan was the center of a vast economic network of managers, artists and stage directors, all of whom deferred to him; a few years ago Mr. Mortier attacked the ""Mafia-like conditions"" that held sway during the festival.","Critic's Notebook; Salzburg, a Festival in Transition Without the Karajan Mystique",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-salzburg-a-festival-in-transition-without-the-karajan-mystique.html

On Saturday night, 8,000 members of the public attended free open rehearsals, followed by an outdoor screening of John Cassavetes's film about theater life, ""Opening Night."" At the opening ceremony of the festival on Sunday morning, the main address was given by the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989; he spoke in an informal style about the need for international disarmament and the eventual dissolution of all national borders, a harbinger, perhaps, of the esthetic version of internationalism Mr. Mortier represents. The main opening performance was not a grand opera grandly performed, as was usually the case, but, in a sign of increased emphasis on theater, a new production of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" by the German director Peter Stein, who has also been made the festival's first superviser of all dramatic presentations.","Critic's Notebook; Salzburg, a Festival in Transition Without the Karajan Mystique",https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-salzburg-a-festival-in-transition-without-the-karajan-mystique.html

Nor was the conductor among the handful of major stars one thinks of as easily commanding ticket prices that range from about $110 to $250. Instead, Nikolaus Harnoncourt was making his festival debut conducting the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, a group of relatively young players, who tended to display some scrappy informality in their ensemble work. The instruments were early 19th-century horns and drums and strings.

The festival, which will run through Aug. 30, will include a series of Messiaen's works, including a major production of ""St. Francois d'Assise,"" directed by Peter Sellars; this marks a shift in festival repertory as well as a shift in directorial taste. Moreover, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will be in the pit, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen; the production costs are being shared by the orchestra and the Opera de la Bastille of Paris. In addition to the Los Angeles, another American orchestra will be appearing: the Cleveland. Simon Rattle will bring his City of Birmingham Orchestra. The Leningrad Philharmonic will play.

Mr. Mortier represents a shift in the very meaning of the festival. Until now, it has been in performance and repertory inseparable from the Austrian and German traditions. In the 1920's and 30's, the festival focused on Mozart and Goethe and Strauss and Beethoven. As the historian Michael P. Steinberg has shown, the festival was founded to help create a coherent image of a fractured culture.

We expunged the epidemic from our textbooks. It became policy of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to minimize drug information by dampening discussions in school. The Motion Picture Association of America had a policy that any picture that even mentioned drugs would not receive a seal of approval.

Such slabs are sections of the sea floor that slowly plunge deep into the earth along ""subduction"" zones, chiefly around the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean, creating the volcanic activity of that region's ""ring of fire."" Earthquakes in such zones can sometimes be traced to depths of several hundred miles, presumably marking the path of a slab's descent.",Dents Detected in Boundary of Earth's Interior,https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/science/dents-detected-in-boundary-of-earth-s-interior.html

Guy Masters of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps, which is part of the University of California at San Diego and reported in the Feb. 27 issue of the journal Nature.

While in most areas around the globe the depth of the transition layer remained close to 400 miles, under Japan it dipped 15 miles. This, the authors believe, was in response to the force of the descending slab.

Born in 1876 to a middle-class Jewish family in Brittany, he rejected his parents' ambitions and endured a life of bohemian poverty as an artist, struggling against his homosexual inclinations and becoming a devout convert to Roman Catholicism. Jacob's life ended in 1944 when he died of pneumonia in a Nazi prison. This volume, lucidly translated and scrupulously edited by Moishe Black and Maria Green, brings together some of Jacob's best prose for the first time in English. An observant student of human nature and a gifted mimic, Jacob excelled in the creation of characters. But his satirical portraits are gentle rather than cruel, for he was an optimist at heart, with a great tolerance for people's foibles. These qualities are evident in the anthology's selections from his novel ""The Bouchaballe Property,"" a fictionalized rendering of his native village, as well as from ""Film-Flam,"" a diverse grouping of vivid character sketches, and ""The Dark Room,"" a collection of imaginary letters. Jacob was a sincere believer that suffering teaches compassion and brings us closer to God, and the editors have also represented the visionary and mystical aspects of his personality.
